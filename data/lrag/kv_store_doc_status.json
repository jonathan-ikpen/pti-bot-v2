The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil $&$ gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry.\n\nAs you peruse through the training brochure, we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company.\n\nAt PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.\n\nPTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.\n\nDr. Henry A.

In his welcome speech, the Acting Principal of the PTI, Engr. Dr. Samuel E. Onoji expressed the readiness of PTI for the partnership.\n\nOnoji, represented by Dr. (Mrs.) Tina Olubukola Isichei, the Director of Research and Development, took the visitors through the various capacities and research the institution had achieved in the past 50 years.\n\nAccording to Isichei, “PTI has led in research and consultancy in oil and gas technology to produce technicians and other skilled personnel in the industry not only in Nigeria but across Africa. “And indeed, the reason for the establishment of the institute was part of the requirements of the country to the fans of OPEC as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.\n\n“Now our mission is to become the leading oil and gas Technological Institute in Africa while our mission is to provide competent technological manpower, to quality training, research, and consultancy for the pendulum and allied industries. “Now, we have been in this business for over 50 years. We celebrated our Golden Jubilee in 2022. And I must say that we have produced more than 50,000 technologists, technicians, and other technical personnel in various areas in the oil and gas and allied industries.” She added. In his speech, Ajaifia said, $\\\\mathfrak{w}\\_{\\\\mathbb{I}}$ am very impressed with the visit to the Petroleum Training Institute. OPTS is a partner with the people of Nigeria in terms of the oil and gas business and we are supportive of Nigerian content. We are supportive of developing competence in the oil and gas operations.\n\n${\\\\mathrm{\"}}{\\\\mathsf{S}}\\_{0},$ our visit today has shown the high degree of capacity and potential that the Petroleum Institute has in helping to bridge the gap we see in competence and capacity within the oil and gas industry. “We are going to work with the school authority to try to find ways of helping the industry to develop that needed capacity, not only for Nigeria but also for the rest of Africa.\n\n“We see a lot of potential in this institution, and we are going to do our best to support PTI as a major capacity hub in the oil and gas industry.\n\n“Today is like a homecoming for me. And I believe that there is there’s more opportunity to develop leaders for the future in this country.\n\n“Now PTI has contributed a lot to the quality of leadership we have in the oil and gas industry. A lot of the graduates of these institutes are in high places in the country, some have developed their own businesses that are highly successful.\n\n“And I think that what we need to do is to support the institution in terms of funding, so that they can take the linear role in terms of research, because we need research, to be able to develop that level of independence.\n\n“You know, if you don’t have independence, then you are not here. So PTI has the potential to lead in terms of research and development in our sector. And I think providing them with the required funding, and opportunity, the school will we go to higher places.” He stated. \n\nurl: https://pti.edu.ng/2021/04/26/invitation-to-tender-for-2021-capital-projects/ \n content: Back\n\n## Uncategorized\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/projects.jpg)\n\nThe Petroleum Training Institute Effurun hereby invites interested, competent, and reputable consultants, contractors, and suppliers with relevant experience to make submissions for the supply, installation, and construction of equipment/projects for the year 2021 capital appropriations. [Click here for details](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/PTI-ITT_EOI.pdf)\n\n- Share:\n- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fpti.edu.ng%2F2021%2F04%2F26%2Finvitation-to-tender-for-2021-capital-projects%2F \"Facebook\")\n\n- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpti.edu.ng%2F2021%2F04%2F26%2Finvitation-to-tender-for-2021-capital-projects%2F&text=Invitation%20to%20Tender%20for%202021%20Capital%20Projects \"Twitter\")\n\n- [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpti.edu.ng%2F2021%2F04%2F26%2Finvitation-to-tender-for-2021-capital-projects%2F&description=The%20Petroleum%20Training%20Institute%20Effurun%20hereby%20invites%20interested%2C%20competent%2C%20and%20reputable%20consultants%2C%20contractors%2C%20and%20suppliers%20with%20relevant%20experience%20to%20make%20submissions%20for%20the%20supply%2C%20installation%2C%20and%20construction%20of%20equipment%2Fprojects%20for%20%26hellip%3B%20&media=https%3A%2F%2Fpti.edu.ng%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2021%2F04%2Fprojects.jpg \"Pinterest\")\n\n\n[![](https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d2892f9e4b35f0bb6db46ce241ac1c1f?s=250&r=g&d=mm)](https://pti.edu.ng/author/admin/)\n\n[admin](https://pti.edu.ng/author/admin/)\n\nPrevious post\n\n##### [Resumption Date For Newly Admitted Students](https://pti.edu.ng/2021/03/18/resumption-date-for-newly-admitted-students/)\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\nNext post\n\n##### [Invitation for Expression of Interest for Appointment of External Auditors.](https://pti.edu.ng/2021/04/26/invitation-for-expression-of-interest-for-appointment-of-external-auditors/)\n\nApril 26, 2021\n\n### You may also like\n\n[![b2s2](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/b2s2-300x200.jpg)](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/08/18/post-utme-screening-exercise/ \"Post UTME Screening Exercise!!!\")\n\n##### [Post UTME Screening Exercise!!!](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/08/18/post-utme-screening-exercise/)\n\n18 August, 2024\n\n[![OPTS](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OPTS-300x200.jpg)](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/07/28/oil-producers-pti-to-partner-for-manpower-development/ \"Oil Producers, PTI to partner for Manpower Development\")\n\n##### [Oil Producers, PTI to partner for Manpower Development](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/07/28/oil-producers-pti-to-partner-for-manpower-development/)\n\n28 July, 2024\n\n[![auditor](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/auditor-300x200.png)](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/07/27/postponement-of-resumption-for-the-second-semester-2023-2024-academic-session/ \"Postponement of Resumption for the Second Semester 2023/2024 Academic Session.\")\n\n##### [Postponement of Resumption for the Second Semester 2023/2024 Academic Session.](https://pti.edu.ng/2024/07/27/postponement-of-resumption-for-the-second-semester-2023-2024-academic-session/)\n\n27 July, 2024\n\n[Back To Top](https://pti.edu.ng/2021/04/26/invitation-to-tender-for-2021-capital-projects/#)\n\n#### Login with your site account\n\n[iframe](https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api2/anchor?ar=1&k=6LcMlZUdAAAAAKRrEsJJyiQoVAvn8iLQjkcnmFPr&co=aHR0cHM6Ly9wdGkuZWR1Lm5nOjQ0Mw..&hl=en&v=hbAq-YhJxOnlU-7cpgBoAJHb&size=normal&cb=hqz696snfiuq)\n\n[Lost your password?](https://pti.edu.ng/account/?action=lostpassword \"Lost Password\")\n\nRemember Me\n\n[iframe](https://www.recaptcha.net/recaptcha/api2/bframe?hl=en&v=hbAq-YhJxOnlU-7cpgBoAJHb&k=6LcMlZUdAAAAAKRrEsJJyiQoVAvn8iLQjkcnmFPr) \n\nurl: https://pti.edu.ng/wp-login.php?redirect_to \n content: #

Any agenda aimed at generating sustainable development in the Niger Delta and beyond,must seek ways of providing global standard trainings, and increased indigenous involvement in the Oil and Gas and Allied Industries. This aim can only be achieved by providing world class standards educated,equipped and certified populate. The PTI Skills Acquisition Programme thereforealignswith thisgoal,asit will fill the gaps,by providing skilled employable Nigerian Youths. Also,this programwilladdresstheOil &Gascompany's excuses fornot employingunskilledyouths in thecountry.\n\nThe drive behind the PTI Youth Skill Acquisition Programme is to fill the gaps created by technological dynamics playing in the Oil & Gas and Allied Industries.The Industriesviewpoint,guides therequired skill programmewith efficient bestpractices atthe different levels within each technical discipline. This Programme will enhance sustainable development of Nigeria communities,by providing array of quality skill intervention trainings forNigerianYouths (skilled,unskilled and semiskilled individuals).\n\nThisMentoring and tutelage would provide the certified graduate trainees with opportunities to build skills and pursue occupational or career development in gainful employment.In general,the concept of 'entrepreneurial mentoring',involves one entrepreneur acting as'critical friendor'guide”,helping tooversee the career and development of a less experiencedentrepreneur.\n\nSome of the wealth from the Oil and Gas industry must be channelled to developing Human Capacity Development by funding skill acquisition educationforNigerian youths Expected outcomes-Graduateswould:\n\na.

Dr. Celestine Iyamu Emerges the National President of the PTI Alumni Association\n\nDr Celestine Iyamu recently emerged the National President of the Alumni Association of the Petroleum Training Institute, (PTI) Effurun, assuring that his team has a lot of visions and plans to take the alumni to greater heights.\n\nIn his word, “We will contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of the oil and gas sector of the nation’s economy as alumni of the PTI. It is on good record that graduands of this great Institute are proud of the school. Many of us have also gone to other institutions to get higher degrees and certificates. But the PTI is our base, so we are very proud of the school”.\n\nSpeaking further, Dr. Iyamu noted that, $\\\\mathfrak{w}\\_{\\\\mathbb{I}}$ have three years tenure as the president, and I want to focus on three areas. One is to complete the PTI alumni building started by the old executive in the school. Within a space of one year, we should complete that building.\n\n“Secondly, I also want to get our graduands all over the world that are yet to be active in the alumni to come in. Many of them are in high places. For instance, Professor Kalu Osiri, in the United States of America, he is the owner of a university, he graduated from the PTI. He has assured he would come on board.\n\n“The third vision is to give the alumni a political power, that power that will help us take the alumni to greater heights. Outside finance, we need the political power as a body to attract government’s attention. It will make government give the Institute attention. We should develop the links with political leaders”.\n\nSpeaking on the poor funding facing the Institute, Dr. Iyamu said, “My appeal to Mr. President is that politics should not come into the PTI. The government should give adequate funding to the PTI, compel the Petroleum Technology Development Fund, (PTDF) to fund the PTI adequately, Tertiary Education Trust Fund, (TETfund) and other agencies should do the same”.\n\nIn the words of Dr. Iyamu, “Mr. President should see the PTI as one instrument to up-scale his achievements. The Ministry of Petroleum resources should ensure that the Institute gets adequate funding for the Institute. Also, The Federal Government can engage the alumni in finding solutions to challenges in the oil and gas sector. We can be part of government panels and committees to provide solutions. We have many of our graduands that are playing great roles in the oil and gas sector across the globe.\n\n“The current National president of Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, (PENGASSAN), Engr Festus Osifo is a product of the PTI. So, you see we have many of the right persons that can help government add value to the oil and gas sector”, he noted. \n\nurl: http://pti.edu.ng/testimonials/john-doe/ \n content: Back\n\n## Testimonials\n\n![john-doe](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/john-doe.jpg)\n\n### John Doe\n\nArt director\n\n“ LearnPress is a WordPress complete solution for creating a Learning Management System (LMS).

To achieve structured training and sustainable growth in the oil sector,there was need for soundnational lawsandpolicies that could easily be implemented, said Akpofure.\n\nGoing through the memory lane of the extant Acts andregulatory Agencies such as thePetroleum Act, 1969,PTDFActof1973,NDDCAct, 2000,Nigerian Content Development Act,2005,Nigerian Oil and Gas\n\nIndustry Content Development Act, $2010,$ and the PTI Act CAP P16, 2004,as amended,established in 1973,as a pre-requisite for the membership of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),the University Don called on all stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to implement the oil policies in the country.\n\nDr.Akpofure who described PTI as a destination of choice for training and certification in the oil and gas Industry,observed that the Institute has taken great strides in meeting the objective for which it was set up,the development of manpower needed to operate the essential sector of the nation's economy,which was crude oil exploration,exploitation and processing.\n\nHe expressed the view that oil companies should operate within the regulatory framework;they should ensure that their workers are structurally trained and able to demonstrate that they could apply knowledge and skills to the standard legally required.\n\nThe Don also underlined the concerns of the ineffective implementation of the relevant laws, policies and the destination of choice in competent training and certification in the oil and gas industry is the Petroleum Training Institute.\n\nHe recommended that\"the developed legalandregulatory framework should befully addressed by the Nigerian government so as to promote properandeffective implementation of the Nigerian Content Policy which will aid in achievingindustrial growth\":\n\nEarlier,the Principal/Chief Executive of the Institute,Prof. Sunny E.Iyuke,made passionate appeal for a better funding and support from the government and patronage of theInternational Oil Companies(IOCs)to enable PTI fulfill its statutory functions of developing theneeded workforce for the oil industry.To develop a corresponding trainingin line with global standards,the Principal called for assistance in the development of research,cutting edge training facilities and Digitization of Petroleum Training Institute (DiPTI).\n\nProf. lyuke also solicited for collaboration in staff exchange and Industrial Training Attachment (IT) for the students,adding that PTI graduates get hands on teaching and upon graduation do not necessarily need on the job training. He expressed thebelief that PTI graduates possess good quality skills toperform whatever taskwith little orwithout supervision.The IOCs who had PTl products in their employ could attest to thisfact.\n\nOn the need for collaboration between PTI and the IOCs,\"PTI has grown.The companieshad also developed.With their support,I am sure we will be there.We come to\n\n...cont'donpg.12 ..cont'd from pg.11\n\n![](http://pti.edu.ng/tmp/a743e19f-cfc9-4c9f-ad54-5e5ee5711886/images/2878aac905694b9519de4b0c146e4d99ee2e8f1fc0b36cf5ce2264f584ce0d89.jpg)\n\nProf.S.E.Iyuke\n\nyou for training andyou support us. Ifyou do not support us,we would not find it easy”,he averred.\n\nlyuke further stressed that the IOCs should have confidence in the PTl,as it has an enviable track record in the development of competent technical manpower for the nation's oil and gas sector.He reiterated, $^{41}$ will transform the PTI to a world-class Institute thatwill train and provide competent manpower required for the operation of the oil and gas and allied companies in and around the globe.\n\nHe gave the inkling that the Institute wouldreview its programmes and ensure that its certificates remained apropos to the sector.He went further to say that PTI has signed a deal with the Ministry of Energy of Benin Republic for the trainingofitspersonnel in Petroleum and GasProcessing. Geosciences and Petroleum Marketing and Business Studies.\n\nAlso,to place the Institute on the global map,the PTI would be digitized.According to the new Principal/Chief Executive,the digitization of the PTl,sobriquet DiPTl,would be designed to assist the youth to achieve their aspiration. The DiPTl would be a place of new beginning;the projectwould be really about youths,creating jobs for the future and a space for digital innovation,he said cheerily.\n\nProf. lyuke called on all stakeholders in the Oil Industry to support the PTI to move it to the next level;and to be a choice destination for the development of competentmanpower for the nation's oil and gas sector and beyond.\n\nAlso speaking,the General Manager,Services,NAPIMS who was represented by Mr.Loveday Mina, lauded therolePTI played in the past in the development ofmiddle level manpower,adding that quite a number of them were trained in the Institute.\n\nHe promised thatNAPIMSwould collaborate with PTl to achieve its goals,and enjoined other stakeholders tojoin handswith PTI to develop the needed manpower for the oil and gas sector.\n\n# Stakeholders ListWays on How to Curb Pipeline Vandalism, Militancy in Niger Delta\n\nIn the same vein,stakeholders who earlier convened at the lst bi annual learningManagers of Oil/gas and Allied Companiesand PTI Management hosted by Petroleum TechnologyDevelopment Fund (PTDF) in Abuja recently,had listed ways on how to curb the incessant pipeline vandalism,oil theft, kidnapping and militancy in the country,especially in the oil rich Niger Delta region.\n\nTo effectively curb these vices, theworkshopmaintained that Nigeria must overcome the toxic and explosive relationshipbetween the corporate organizations and their host communities.\n\nThe workshop pinpointed the PTI as a veritable agency for mediation between government, corporate bodies and host communities to achieve lasting industrialand peaceful host community relations thereby curbing incessant attacks on pipelines.\n\nIn view of the massive corruption which has retarded the growth of the oil industry,they urged the government to expedite thepassage of thePetroleum Industry Bill (PIB)to attract the requisite foreign direct investment (fdi) into the oil and gas sector.\n\nThe stakeholders also stressed the need to develop the steel industry in order to establish the basic steel infrastructure for easy access to steelproducts and its auxiliary facilities for effective pipeline management.\n\nThe workshop called on the government to utilize the facilities of thePTl as themajor training Institute in the country backed by an actofparliament for the development ofcompetent technical manpower for the oil andgas sector.\n\nOn the need to galvanize the PTl, the learning Managers asked the Federal Government to enact relevant legislations to engage PTl in conjunction with Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)in ensuring thatpetroleum products imported into the countrymeet\n\nacceptable standards in terms of quality and safety.\n\nThe stakeholders applauded the unique role of the PTl as the only trainingInstitute that provides the trainingsolution to the contemporary training requirement, in the oil and gas sector.\n\nIn a keynote address,the Vice Principal,PTl,Mrs.Emily E. Arhagba,posited that the workshop was very significant to the sustainability of development in the oil and gas sector,with emphasis on the training of the next generation of leaders who constitute themiddle level managers in the industry.\n\n\"Any genuine discussion on energy must revolve around a seamless transfer ofnew and emergent skills to this critical group on whom the future of the industry rests\",stated Mrs.Arhagba.\n\nThe Vice Principal further said thatPTI has an enviable trackrecord in the development of competent technical human capital for the nation's oil industry to tool and retool oil personnel to effectively handle these challenges.\n\nEarlier, the then Acting Executive Secretary,Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) Mr.Ahmed G.Aminu disclosed thatwith the estimated proven gasreservesof182 trillion cubic feet,the sector if effectively harnessed is capable of enhancing the economic growth potentialof the nation particularly if the gas that is being flared is channel to complement domestic energy demand.\n\n\"Wemust workhard to developnew strategiesto complementgovernmenteffort to achieving a viable,sustainable and efficient oil and gas sector”,he submitted.\n\n![](http://pti.edu.ng/tmp/a743e19f-cfc9-4c9f-ad54-5e5ee5711886/images/a0aab7eb005536957e8432c73c7371464f64746fa713a80516462da764921dad.jpg)\n\nAcrosssectionoflearningManagersatthe2ndbi-anmualworkshopheldinLagos\n\n# PTI Convocation: FG To Expand Role of PTI In Oil & Gas Sector\n\n![](http://pti.edu.ng/tmp/a743e19f-cfc9-4c9f-ad54-5e5ee5711886/images/c53eb2bc3855fcb61b32f085f519f7b41c8488e16f9fb6d5bc91cac469b7a11e.jpg)\n\nMinister fStatePetroleumResources\n\n-MinisterGivesScholarships,EmploymentToBest Graduands -PTI Well Equipped ToDevelop Oil IndustryPersonnel-DirectorDPR -PTIToRunPGD,MScProgrammes-Principal/CE,PTI\n\nB.A.UkanefimoniO.G.UdemezueandV.T.Abigor\n\nhe Minister of State,Petroleum Resources,Dr.Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu has stated that the Federal Governmentwould expand therole of the Petroleum Training Institute in the oil and gas sector.\n\nDr.Emmanuel I.Kachikwu stated this following a tour of facilities during theInstitute's 2016 Convocation ceremony held at the PTI Conference Centre Complex recently.\n\nAmazed by theinfrastructural development and upgraded facilities provided by the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF),said that the PTI is well equipped toplay a leadingrole to bridge the gapin producing local\n\n![](http://pti.edu.ng/tmp/a743e19f-cfc9-4c9f-ad54-5e5ee5711886/images/7f9df0e185a1d65b62f6231e012345d67eeb0378a0004be8428681b4605246f5.jpg)\n\nmanpower and foreign domination of the oil and gas sector.\n\nJustifying the role expansion of the Institute,he averred, \"Govermment will do all it can to expand the role of PTI in providing needed facilities in the sector as a means of cutting cost in the sector”.\n\nThe Minister gave an inkling that a road map for the oiland gassector entails short,medium,and long term priorities.To this end,he disclosed thata road mapwouldalsobe worked outfor thePTI tobecome the leading oil and gas training Institute in Africa.

In a similar way,the earth's atmosphere bottles up the energyofthe sun and said to act like a“greenhouse” where CO2 acts like glass windows since Co2 molecules are transparent to sunlightradiation butnot tothe heat radiation. However,Green house effect can be defined as the progressive warming up of the earth's surface due to blanketing effect of manmadeC02inthe atmosphere or as the phenomenon due to which earth retains heat. The major green house gases are:\n\nCarbon-dioxide(most common and important greenhouse gas) Methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide(CFCs). +Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Watervapour (proportion varies with temperature). Aerosol spray (in form of perform,deodorant, fragrance,etc, commonly used in car).\n\nThe greenhouse effect is not a bad thing by itself because it allowed earth to stay warmenough forlife to survive.Under normal concentration of CO2,the temperature of the earth's surface ismaintained by the energy balance of the sun rays that strike the planet and the heat thatisradiated into the outer space. Consequently,when the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases beyond normal,the thick envelope of this gas absorbs radiation from sun and prevents the heat from beingre-radiated out.\n\nThus,the thick CO2 layer acts like the glass panels ofa green house or thewindowglass ofa closed car,allowingthe sun rays to filter through but preventing the heat from escaping in the outer space there warming the troposphereof the atmosphere that eventually resulting to atmospheric and climatic changes.\n\nHow Greenhouse Effect isproduced in a Car\n\nWhen we park our car outside for some hours where there is no shade of any kind and the car is in direct glare of the sun with windows closed since we are afraid of car theft. At the point of leaving,when we open the door of the car and entre inside,our body experiences ahigher temperature difference. This is because of the difference between ambient outdoor temperature and the temperature inside the car.\n\nThe knowledge of thermodynamics guides us of the thermal equilibrium that supposed to exist insidethe car andits surrounding.but the total heat energy in the car is not simply due to the energy entering the car from the sun or from thermal contact with the atmosphere.It is much higher due to the heat trappingactionof the greenhouse effect.\n\nThe sun'sradiations enter through your car's windows and some of the heat from the sun is absorbed by the seats/belt seats, dashboards, carpets, rugs,upholstery etc.when these objects release this heat, it does not all get out through the windows but ratherreflected backin.The heat isradiated at different wavelength less than the wavelength of sun's radiation that made it through the windows.Thus, as more heat energy is going in,less is going out. This resultsinto agradual increase in the heat that is produced in the car until it gets tounbearable point that when you open your car,you feel the heat trapping greenhouse effect in the car,which is similar to thegreenhouse effectyou experienceinthe troposphere.\n\nThe excessive exposure to solar radiations through greenhouse effect in a hot car can cause thefollowing:\n\nSkincancer Alterimmune system Vulnerable infectious diseases 中Cataract and eyediseases $\\\\hat{\\\\mathbf{\\\\xi}}\\_{\\\\mathbf{p}}^{\\\\mathbf{\\\\xi}}\\\\mathbf{\\\\bar{\\\\eta}}$ Heatstroke\n\nThe following preventive methods can be explored to reduce greenhouse effect in ahotcar:\n\n$\\\\clubsuit$ Do not wind up your car windows fully when you parked your car.\n\n$\\\\clubsuit$ Always look for a shady area to parkyour car.\n\nUse car cover or window shade when you are parking your car for a longtime.\n\nAlways wind down your car windows for at least between $^{2}-5$ minutes before you put your air conditioner into use.\n\nAvoid the use of highly concentrated aerosol spray in formof perfume,deodorant, fragrance,insecticide etc especially when your car air conditioner isinuse.\n\n# Conclusion\n\nThe greenhouse effect in a hot car is already traced to some health effects on human beings when exposed.However, some preventive methods suggested here would greatly help in curtaining or reducing the problems associated with these effects.Please,let us all take to these suggested points which can keep us away from thevulnerable diseases that can be caused by greenhouse effect in our vehicles.\n\n# PTI,FUPRE To Synergise...\n\ncomplements PTl.What FUPREcan do PTI cannot do it toa largeextentand what PTl can do FUPREcannot do toalargeextent toohe said.\n\nSpeakingon intellectual property which was supposed to be the bedrock of Nigerian universities,he said the only way this could be achieved was for the Federal Government to adequately fund the tertiary Institution to enable them produce patents that could be beneficial to move the Petroleum Technology forward.\n\n.cont'd frompg.19\n\nThe Vice Chancellor,Prof. Ibhadode was accompanied on thevisit by the Deputy Vice Chancellor,Prof.J.Arubayi,Prof.E.Adomi, Mr. S.

SUNNY E. IYUKE ON THURSDAY, ${\\\\bf{29^{H}}}$ SEPTEMBER, 2016 ON THE OCCASION OF LEARNING MANAGERS’ WORKSHOP OF OIL/GAS AND ALLIED COMPANIES AND PTI MANAGEMENT HELD AT ELION HOUSE, DOLPHIN ESTATE, IKOYI, LAGOS.\n\nTHE DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES (DPR), THE MANAGING DIRECTOR, NAPIMS, MANAGEMENT OF PTI,\n\nLEARNING MANAGERS OF OIL/GAS AND ALLIED COMPANIES, THE GUEST LECTURER, Dr. Akpofure Rime Rukeh DISTINGUISHED PARTICIPANTS, GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.\n\nIt is with great delight and honour that I welcome you all to the $2016;2^{\\\\mathsf{n d}}$ bi-annual workshop of Learning Managers of Oil/Gas and Allied Companies and PTI Management which today is being graciously hosted by NAPIMS.\n\nThis workshop is very dear to me, being the first time to interface with learning Managers of the oil and gas industry following my appointment as the substantive Principal/Chief Executive of the PTI. From the records, I also observed that the workshop is held as scheduled this year. This is an indication that the oil companies are determined to support the Petroleum Training Institute to achieve its goals as the training and manpower development arm of the industry. May I thank all participants who have travelled far and wide to participate in today’s workshop. I have no doubt in my mind that your presence is a sign of your commitment, not only to PTI but to the petroleum industry and your desire to take it to the next level of growth and relevance.\n\nIt is a common knowledge that the PTI is statutorily saddled with the responsibility of developing competent technical manpower for the oil and gas sector and to carrying out research into oil and gas related activities, processes and products from upstream, midstream and downstream. Today’s workshop is part of your collaborative effort at enhancing her effectiveness through intellectual exchange and bridging the needs gap. It is against this background that learning Managers and Stakeholders have convened to brainstorm and develop a synergy between PTI and the industries. This workshop also provides a platform to collectively strategise to identify the challenges facing the oil and gas sector such as dearth of technical manpower, obsolete legislation, amongst others.\n\nIn view of the multifarious challenges currently confronting the oil and gas sector, we cannot stand aloof from what is happening in the country. We must key into the change mantra of this present administration. Therefore, it is the statutory responsibility of all stakeholders to join forces with the Institute to train technologists and technicians of sub professional level who can apply theoretical and practical knowledge to produce the desired results. I wish to state at this juncture, that PTI has an enviable track record in the development of competent technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector. I wish to reiterate that under the new PTI Management, the Petroleum Training Institute will be transformed to a world class Institute that will train and provide competent manpower required for the operations of the oil/gas and allied companies in and around the globe.\n\nMy Management team and I are determined to transform the PTI to be responsive to the needs of the industry. To this end, we have developed a road map to galvanize the PTI into activities of realizing its training and research mandate. The Institute will review its programmes and ensure the PTI certificate; HND and ND remain relevant to the needs of the oil and gas sector locally and internationally. Programmes of the Institute will be upgraded with provision of eclassrooms in collaboration with international Universities.\n\nIn the area of Research and Development (R&D), we will carry out research in Nigerian Refineries, Exploration and Production, metering, midstream and the entire value of the downstream oil and gas operations. Besides obtaining license for modular and Micro-refinery, the Institute will also carry out research and investment in Renewable Energy such as Bio- ethanol, Solar, Wind, etc. To realizing these laudable goals require huge funds. This is where Private Public Partnership (PPP) and active support from the international oil companies and oil industry stakeholders will be needed.\n\nOn ICT, we are in a technology-driven world. So for effectiveness and efficiency, and for the fact that PTI is a technological Institute, we must use cutting edge technology for training, learning, and research to enhance all operations. I am delighted to inform the workshop that strategic development will be launched to digitalize the Petroleum Training Institute, tagged ‘DIPTI’. DIPTI will be a place of new beginning; the project is really about youth, creating jobs of the future, and creating a space for digital innovation.\n\nThe project will provide forum where all courses are digitized for e-platform applications and delivery; Certification of Technologists and Technicians; Students Experimental Training; Intellectual and Technology transfer; and Staff Training for Certificate in Telecommunications Policy, Regulation and Management (TPRM). It is our hope that the upgraded PTI will look for organizations that will not only partner with the DiPTI but to grow the Institute into the future, but will also derive benefits from being involved in the PTI in general. Please, let us join hand to develop this project.\n\nDistinguished ladies and gentlemen, may I inform you that the Institute has collaboration with the Ministry of Energy, Benin Republic to train her personnel in petroleum and gas processing, Petroleum and Geosciences and in Petroleum and Business Studies. The first batch of trainees has arrived the Institute.\n\nWe hope to strive very hard to place the PTI at the right advantage to maintain the leadership as the training centre of Excellence. However, this cannot be achieved in isolation, but with the collective contributions from this workshop.\n\nI wish to use this rear opportunity to respectfully invite you to the PTI 2016 Convocation Ceremony holding on $8^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ October, 2016, at the PTI Conference Centre, Effurun, Delta State.\n\nI wish to once again, sincerely thank NAPIMS for playing host to this workshop. I also appreciate other companies who have played host to the workshop and those who will host in the future. I sincerely appreciate all participants who are in today’s workshop.\n\nI join NAPIMS to welcome you all to Lagos. I cherish your presence and thank you profoundly for honouring our invitation. I wish all of us very fruitful deliberations. Prof. Sunny E.

Abigor\n\nI n a bid to make a huge impact in the nation's oil and gas sector, the Petroleum Training Institute, the foremost technological manpower development institution in Nigeria is set to partner with Nigerdock Nigeria Limited, to build a Modular Refinery in the Institute.\n\nThis was disclosed recently when Nigerdock Nigeria Limited Executive General Manager, Fabrication and Production, Engr. Oluwale Salu and his team visited Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke to concretize plans for the construction of the modular refinery.\n\nAccording to Engr. Salu, the visit was a follow up on the processes to finalize details on the building of Modular Refinery in the Institute, which is estimated to cost about fifteen million U.S dollars and on a 15 month implementation schedule.\n\nWhen completed, the Modular Refinery is expected to process 1500 bpd of crude oil. It is also expected to generate its own power. The project, which has enormous academic benefits, would be used for practical teaching and industrial attachment training for students. It would serve as centre for research and development purposes and will have some other commercial streams which could generate new revenue for the Institute.\n\nthat for the Institute to make headway in its determination to build a Modular Refinery, there was need for PTI to partner with a reputable company such as Nigerdock.\n\nHe hinted that the Institute has the ideal site and the technological base for such a gigantic project. The project would also afford both Staff and Students of the Institute the opportunity to be involved in the building processes of the Modular Refinery.\n\nTo accelerate work on the project, a technical committee composed of PTI and Nigerdock officials were put in place by the Principal for smooth coordination of the project. The PTI team led by the Director/Chief Coordinator, PTI Consult Services, Mrs. H.T.S. Momoh, conducted the visitors on tour of the Institute's facilities.\n\nEarlier in his remarks, the PTI Chief Executive, Prof. Iyuke said Mr. Ahmad Rufai Shakur, Acting Director of Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/dbe022ca67becfa1adbd05d203baa39f055feb6d79ade9f1aa9a3f4801af5d46.jpg)\n\nEngr.

Iyuke has on behalf of Council, Management, Academic Board, Staff and Students congratulated the new Acting Director, Mr. A. R. Shakur and wished him a successful tenure.\n\n# PTI to Run Hybrid ND - M.Tech Programmes\n\n…As Prof. Iyuke Unveils 5 Year Plan Lucky Akaighe & Precious Oroghwarejighe (IT) Student The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) would run a hybrid National Diploma leading to the award of Masters of Technology (M.Tech) within the next five years.\n\nThe Principal and Chief Executive of the Institute, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke dropped this hint while unveiling a five year plan for the Institute during a seminar entitled $^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}5$ -Year Plan of Academic Directorates”, aimed at repositioning the Institute in order to meet the 21st century challenges in the oil and gas sector.\n\nProf. Iyuke stated that the Petroleum Training Institute, would within the next five years award a Masters of Technology (M.Tech) to PTI graduates as against the Higher National Diploma (HND) certificate it had been awarding over four decades.\n\nJustifying the award of the M.Tech, he said that following a meticulous study of the mandate establishing the Institute, there is no clause in the Act limiting it to the training of only middle level manpower; but skilled manpower required for the oil and gas Industry.\n\nThe Principal informed that he has presented this proposal to the Governing Council at its 134th meeting, and Council has given the nod to pursue the hybrid programme as long as it will move the Institute to the next level in the industry.\n\nThe Principal who was optimistic said when the plan comes on stream, PTI would run a hybrid ND to M.Tech programme in affiliation\n\nPrincipal & Chief Executive, Prof. S.E. Iyuke\n\nwith the University of Port-Harcourt (Uniport) for three (3) years, and then go full blown having learnt the ropes within the specified years.\n\nAccording to the Principal, the hybrid ND - M.Tech programme is intended to change the Institute's training capacity to meet the challenges and to be a standard Centre for carrying out research in energy resources.\n\nA breakdown of the 5 year implementation plan leading to the award of M.Tech shows that the Institute would run a two year intensive academic training leading to the award of National Diploma (ND), one (1) year industrial training and then two (2) years continuation into Masters of Technology Programme.\n\nHe charged Staff members to always imbibe the spirit of confidentiality and to always make good use of the Institute's time in driving this vision.\n\n# Council Promotes Engr.

As you are aware, we are encountering problems that\n\nhave to do with high production cost, long contract life cycle, oil spills, crude oil theft and\n\ninsecurity among others. It is\n\nour hope that the Institute can proffer solutions to these\n\nproblems through its training and skills acquisition\n\nprogrammes”.\n\nHe added that the Federal Government has come out with a one-stop-shop arrangement for reviewing and approving projects in a bid to shorten contracting life cycle before the end of 2018. This, he said, would ensure that contract approval cycle is not more than six months; while the cost of crude oil production would be reduced.\n\nKachikwu retorted that the Federal Government plans to deliver not less than 3.4 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day to bridge the medium term supply gap by 2020, adding that government has decided to invest in the Seven Critical Gas Development Projects to achieve this feat in 2020 as the Federal Government had commenced utilization and monetization of the abundant gas resources of the country.\n\nIn his words, “The Federal Government has doubled her efforts in providing effective policies that will drive gas utilization and commercialization. We have decided to invest in the Seven Critical Gas Development Projects in Nigeria. These projects will deliver about 3.4 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day to bridge the mediumterm supply gap by $2020^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$ .\n\nWhile commending the PTI Management for its proactive measures in piloting the affairs of the Institute, Kachikwu tasked the PTI graduands to set goals that would give them a balanced and successful life. “I will also leave you with the words of Steve Jobs which says, “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown your own inner voice”, he advised.\n\nSpeaking, then PTI Governing Council Chairman, Mr. Mordecai D.B.

We do appreciate that the adoption of NDT practice will end the catastrophe imminent in the country as INDTN promotes safety environment”.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, then INDTN President, Engr. Johnson Umukoro disclosed that Nigeria currently has no national NDT accredited qualification framework, adding that lack of funding, well-equipped and updated resources materials for work has constituted a barrier for the Institute.\n\nThen President regretted that Nigeria was not in the world map of NDT, due to the absence of a coordinated institutions in the past. In his words, “As a nation, Nigeria lack adequate certified NDT personnel required to man its various industries, unlike some developed nations such as India, Britain, USA that boast of NDT personnel in their thousands. Besides, there are non-indigenous companies involved in the manufacturing of consumables for NDT applications in Nigeria”.\n\nContinuing, “There are no accredited NDT equipment maintenance and calibration companies in Nigeria. There is high influx of foreign Level III personnel conducting certifications, most times not up to the required standard”.\n\nOn the way forward, then President said the Institute is gearing up towards engaging in a strategic drive to raise a number of well trained and certified NDT personnel, liaise with corporate bodies; government agencies to develop standards and promote the implementation of the best practices in Non-destructive Testing in Nigeria as well as promote research in NDT technology and practice as well as institute a national training and certified programs in NDT, accredited to international standard.\n\n“Worthy of mention, the Institute conducted a level II training and certification recently in preparations for level III training and certification.

Momoh, thanked the Management of NBTC for the visit and said this partnership, when it comes on stream would open new vistas of employment opportunities for the Nigerian teaming youths and for the betterment of the country at large.\n\nThe Principal said, “Business all over the world do better when they collaborate with one another”, adding that there would be need for exchange of staff between both establishments to bridge the gap where one establishment is lagging.\n\nTo this end, he said the Institute is open to collaboration but would go back to its drawing board and come up with a winwin Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that would benefit both Organisations.\n\n“I will transform the Directorate, Apply Technology Basic Engineering Knowledge to Oil and Gas Sector ”– Engr. Ukwuaba, DOE\n\n# Sir, congratulations on your well-deserved appointment as the new Director of Engineering. Tell us about yourself?\n\nI am Engr. Samuel Ifeanyichukwu Ukwuaba, fellows of Nigeria Society of Engineers, Nigeria Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Automotive & Locomotive Engineers of Nigeria and Institute of Registered Administrative Managers of Nigeria. I am also a member of several Professional Societies in Nigeria.\n\nJust recently, I was conferred as a ${}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}{\\\\mathrm{J}}{\\\\mathsf{P}}^{\\\\prime\\\\prime}$ by the Delta State Government of Nigeria. I am also a knight in the Catholic Church. Here in PTI, I came in as a lecturer, I became Head of Department, I was a Head of Department for three terms 2001 – 2011 etc. I was made the Coordinator of\n\nProcurement and General Services which I did for some months, and later found myself as the Acting Director of Engineering before I was confirmed as the substantive Director of Engineering.\n\n# Please, tell us your vision and mission for the Directorate viz-a-viz the Institute?\n\nIn summary I will say that my vision for the Directorate is not different from the vision and mission of the Institute. I will work in partnership with the Management to achieve its goals. However, in order to distinguish this Directorate from any other one, my mission is to be the dream Directorate that will apply technology basic engineering knowledge to solving the problem of the oil and gas sector.\n\nIn solving the problems of the oil & gas sector for which the Institute was set up, what are some of the challenges you envisage in the Directorate hitherto to your appointment, and how do you intend to address them?\n\nWhen you talk about challenges, one will first ask, what are we really doing so that if you say this is a challenge, you know it is a challenge in the right direction.\n\nAs an Academic Directorate our major job is to teach, examine and prepare results. In teaching and collating results we have little challenge there but in the global activities of the Directorate, some of my staff do not even have office, you also see an Assistant Director and\n\nis because PTI supplies manpower for both upstream and downstream sector in the oil and gas industry. For example, Mechanical, Electrical & Petroleum Engineering are upstream based which carry out exploration, drilling and production.\n\nPTI products are everywhere in the oil Industry. What I will do to improve on the gains of my predecessors is to ensure that our curriculum and training meet the oil industry requirements. We also conduct booster courses for the oil industry, train and re-train its personnel to meet their basic job specifications, since most of them who come for these courses are producing companies.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/64a23b9fff05b37e6c80dd43bb804b092f2fc1799bd710030d2e706526820679.jpg)\n\nDeputy Director sharing the same office which is\n\nnot proper.\n\nDuring practicals, you see some\n\nmachines not\n\nworking\n\noptimally.\n\nThough PTI still\n\nremains the best in terms of\n\npracticals in\n\nhigher\n\ninstitutions in\n\nNigeria, but not $100%$ level. As for Directorate Institute Management relationship, the challenges are not there at all, this is because the Principal and Chief Executive, Prof. S.E. Iyuke is committed to taking PTI to the next level. So when we have our dreams, he supports us. Administratively, we have no challenge but in terms of practicals, office machines & office comfort, that is where we have little challenges.\n\nAs an Engineering/Chemical based institution what areas do you think you can improve on the gains of your predecessors? PTI is an engineering based institution. This\n\nAs the Director of Engineering, what machinery have you put in place with other sister agencies in the oil and gas industry to collaborate with PTI?\n\nAs the new\n\nDirector of\n\nEngineering, I\n\nconvened a\n\nmeeting of the\n\nDirectorate Board made up of the Deputy Directors and Heads of Department where we agreed that apart from the effort Management is making to establish relationship with other sister agencies in the oil and gas sector, we on our own will do a parallel job since most of us know these operators. We also intend to create both formal and informal relationship where our Staff would get into the oil industry and have a first-hand knowledge of what they are doing and apply it in training. I have a committee working on this and very soon our result will be out.\n\nIn a technology driven society, the importance of collaboration cannot be overemphasized and considering the importance of technology where new Engineering courses are being introduced, what innovative courses do you intend to introduce in the Directorate of Engineering?\n\nMy team in the Directorate has been operating on a philosophy of team work and I believe in the people I am working with because they are all cooperating with me. We have looked at the operations of the oil industry and mapped out some courses that will enhance and increase PTI's participation in the development of the oil and gas sector.\n\nIn the Departments of Mechanical/Welding, we plan to introduce Corrosion and Material Engineering. Corrosion as you know is a big problem in the industry both upstream & downstream; and we intend to produce personnel that can handle these problems. We also aim to introduce 'Material and Ecology' courses that will handle some of these problems in the plant. Some pipes carry hot fluid, corrosive fluid, very cold fluid and material reacts differently to them. ${\\\\mathsf{S}}0,$ we want to introduce these courses and have a good knowledge of the material we use and recommend which one that will stand the test of time.\n\nIn Petroleum and Natural Gas Processing Department (PNGPD), we want to train people that will handle some derivatives of the downstream sector. The name of the refinery we have here in Warri is called Warri Refining & Petrochemical Company (WRPC) and the 'PC' there, means Petro-Chemical which also produces polymer, so we intend to run a Polymer Course in PTI which has been presented to Management for approval. If approved, it will enable us to produce competent manpower for our refineries.\n\nIn Petroleum Engineering, we are introducing a Geological course which will help us in upstream exploration. PTI is all about Petroleum and Allied Industry. Nigeria is also diversifying, and our mineral resources are being expanded. As a result, only Geological course will help us train manpower to meet these needs.\n\n# Do you really think that the course content of Engineering in PTI can attract partnership with other players in the Industry?\n\nYes. However, it needs improvement. In July this year, I am going to invite some external stakeholders (industries) to critique some of the new courses we are about to mount. There is also a timeline for us to review the course contents which my team is already working on to reflect the oil industry Information Communication Technology (ICT), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and certification for the allied industries. The essence of this is that, if our staff are not certified, they cannot certify other persons.\n\nTherefore, my first step is to convince Management to encourage staff members to pursue certification, since that is the language of the oil industry. My timeline on this proposal having being presented to Management for processing is June 2020. As a member of a committee called “Partnership” we are developing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nigerdock to build a modular refinery in the Institute. I am also a member of a team working on partnership with the Navy to partner with us in diving. I can also tell you that my committee has done its SWOT and GAP analysis and so expect to see more collaborations with industries and other institutions that will make PTI better.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/02ae7bdd975185c23f6af985f69857f9c620a1f165e842f0d33d64f5cef3c752.jpg)\n\nIn one of our recent visit to the Nigerian Navy Engineering College, Sapele, we found areas where PTI and the college can actually collaborate. As the new Director of Engineering, how do you intend to drive this process?\n\nAs a member of a committee working on partnership, my first assignment is to develop areas of collaboration between PTI and the Navy, the tour to that facility (Navy College) came out with its own result which I earlier mentioned would form our Strength, weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT) or GAP analysis. And at the end of the day we would apply what we call Threats, Opportunities, Weakness and Strength (TOWS) to solving it.\n\nI make bold to say that collaborations PTI would have with any Organisation, is collaboration with the Directorate of Engineering.\n\nHaving been saddled with the onus of managing other Departments in your Directorate, how do you intend to carry along the Heads of Department and other rank and file officers in achieving the Directorate of your dream?\n\nI told you that the philosophy of this Directorate is teamwork. No matter how experienced I am, what I know is just a fraction, but when I assemble minds in this Directorate, we will achieve a lot.\n\nAs a Head of Mechanical Department for over six years, I employed the concept of team work and make my subordinates work happily by commending the effort put in achieving any task. My teamwork philosophy is trust-worthiness. My Deputy Directors, Assistant Directors, and staff are all very good and what is required at times is minimal supervision.\n\nHow do you intend to encourage Staff members in your Directorate who are pursuing career or certification courses in Engineering with limited budget?\n\nThe Principal/Chief Executive has already made me a coordinator of sourcing grants from different places, and we are about securing PTDF grant. We have a Committee where our attention is largely on National Diploma (ND) & Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates, so that they will upgrade themselves. And so, without necessarily looking for PTI funds to sponsor such things; I am already working on other places as the coordinator in getting grants and Principal has written a letter we are using to support our drives. At this stage, I would not want you to say how are you encouraging it, I am initiating it and it is my baby and would ensure I pursue it to a logical conclusion. I have about 34 staff that are interested in this grant. Most of these staff surf the net, come out with these companies and the next thing we do is to give them the necessary support. It is my duty to convince Management and advice on the number of staff that can go on such courses. All that we need is to rationalize the selection from the various Departments so as not to collapse the system because everybody wants to go.\n\nAs the new Director of Engineering, do you have any plan to retain outstanding students who have distinguished themselves academically to be recommended for employment in the Institute?\n\nWell, employment has procedures and Nigeria is a place where everything is being politicized. Immediately you make it a law that the best student should be retained, the issue is which Department will produce it.\n\nThe idea is a laudable one which I would table before Management; however, it is the prerogative of the Management to take such decision.\n\n# Prof. Iyuke Commissions Newly Renovated Academic Block\n\nUdemezue Onyinyechi A s part of continued effort geared towards the facelift of the Institute and to provide conducive working environment for personnel, for effective and efficient service delivery, the Principal & Chief Executive of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Prof. Sunny E.

Onoji for prompt delivering of the project and the judicious use of the funds.\n\nResponding on behalf of Academic staff, the Director of Science, Dr. Henry A. Adimula thanked the Principal & Chief Executive for always placing premium on staff comfort.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/e87008a2753e6696c25a1deda6d41b63e98bab93e995b6b4f97d8c62b07b11e9.jpg)\n\n# AGM: PTI CMPCS Members Charged on Savings Culture\n\n… Re-elect Excos … Commissions N47m Office Complex\n\nUdemezue O.G., Akaighe L.O. & Precious Oroghwarejighe (IT) Student Members of Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) Community MultiPurpose Cooperative Society (CMPCS), have been charged to cultivate savings culture to guide against the rainy day, as well as increase their monthly contribution to the Society.\n\nThe President of Petroleum Training Institute PTI CMPCS, Engr. Ephraim Oluwole Ogunyemi who gave the charge recently at the PTI CMPCS 18th Annual General Meeting (AGM) held at PTI Conference Centre Complex, Effurun, informed the members that the Cooperative Society is not left out in the savings beliefs as it has saved two PCE, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke sided by other Management staff as he cut the tape to commission the CMPCS building.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/a5db321ecc18c5d8de1acf1957d9887c64e77465aa523dca99928cf7cf9edeee.jpg)\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/4729adb9bd81af3b60accb7f52fc3f7ff8b0d83406c5859ddb006343c3d06bb7.jpg)\n\nL-R: Urete B., Non-Portfolio member; Jimoh K.T., Treasurer; Esiri, K.H.O., General Secretary; Engr.

Based on this, I want to appeal to our members to cultivate savings culture for the rainy day. I am also glad to inform you that in line with the existing policy of saving for the rainy day, the Society has saved N290m as our security/buffer fund”.\n\nContinuing, he said, “It is hoped that the subsequent Management will continue to build this fund to $\\\\mathsf{N500m}$ as agreed by the General House with the Interim Management Committee (IMC). This will make our Society to remain stronger”, he enthused.\n\nEngr. Ogunyemi assured that the CMPCS is waxing stronger despite the enduring harsh business operating environment in the country. He stated that within the financial year, the Cooperative balance sheet showed upward growth of Four Billion, Six hundred and fifty Million, six hundred and fifty-nine thousand, eight hundred and six Naira (4, 650,659,806) in 2018 as against four Billion, five hundred and thirty-eight million, seventy-five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two Naira (4,538,075,882) in 2017 representing $2.5%$ growth.\n\nReeling out their achievements of the CMPCS in the last one year, he informed the Cooperators that after rigorous negotiation between the Developers and Management Committee members, the lingering Orhuhworun Estate crisis has been laid to rest. Adding that the Estate has been re-designed in line with modern trend, while infrastructure works would commence as soon as the cost per plot is concluded and conveyed to the subscribers.\n\nOne of the major success of the settlement agreement according to him, was that the Developers would use their funds to build while using the Bill of Quantity (BOQ) prepared by Edna\n\nEmuakpeje & Co who represents the PTI Cooperative Society.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cooperators after\n\ncheered the\n\nManagement\n\nCommittee for\n\nresolving the crisis,\n\nand adopted the\n\nproposed name\n\n“Unity Garden Estate” in place of\n\nOrhuhworun Estate.\n\nWhile speaking on the growths recorded within the financial year, Adamu urged Management Committee to learn from the mistake of their predecessors, “We can see growth in our income, we have all done pretty well. We all participated in ensuring this growth. I hope we will not make our previous mistakes”, he advised.\n\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, the Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Aliyu Adamu commended the Management Committee for righting the wrongs of the previous administration as well as pursuing human friendly policies.\n\nThe highpoint of the 18th AGM was a vote confidence passed on the Engr. Ogunyemi led Management Committee as they were unanimously returned for a second term in office.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/3380090d87eec19b29d7e8aede11c5c13572771452786265661f69b77756c1b2.jpg)\n\nPCE, Prof. Iyuke unveiling the marble plaque of the CMPCS building\n\nThe PTI Principal & Chief Executive, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke who was represented by Director, Research & Development, Dr. Bamidele S. Oyetunde stated that the benefit of Cooperative Society cannot be over emphasized hence the need to elect capable hands to pilot the affairs of the CMPCS.\n\nIyuke averred that the CMPCS has guided and encouraged many staff to venture into various degrees of investment with provision of soft loans and low interest loans, he charged the newly employed staff to endeavour to join the Society as they have a lot to benefit.\n\nThe returned\n\nManagement\n\nCommittee saddled with the\n\nresponsibility of\n\npiloting the affairs of the Cooperative for the next one year are: Engr.

The star Prize was won by Mr. Lucky Akaighe of Public Affairs Department.\n\nIn a related development, the PTI CMPCS has commissioned a 47million naira ultra-modern facility amid aplomb and panache.\n\nCommissioning the edifice recently, the Principal and Chief Executive of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke lauded\n\n# AGM: PTI CMPCS ...\n\nthe conceptualization and actualization of the project from past Co-operative Executives to the present one.\n\nProf. Iyuke recalled that on assumption of office 3 years ago, the CMPCS immediate past President, Mr. Peter Brown Agbude (retd.) called on him to perform the foundation laying and today he was also pleased to commission the edifice to the Glory of God.\n\nThe Principal and Chief Executive while citing an example of a patient with cancer, said “if the Institute is the patient, and the CMPCS the cancer, where the host dies, the cancer would also die, but in the event where both cooperate to kill the disease, there is no way the disease would survive”. These suffices to say that the cooperative society was no longer a cancer to the Institute but the duo now enjoy a symbiotic relationship, Prof. Iyuke enthused.\n\nConcluding, he thanked the present Executive for giving him hope while praying that the\n\ncooperation, collaboration and partnership between PTI and CMPCS be sustained for the growth and development of the Institute.\n\nEarlier, the President of the PTI CMPCS, Engr. E. Ogunyemi in his speech, thanked the Principal & Chief Executive and his Management team for their magnanimity in providing the piece of land for the Co-operative to build and for supporting them all the way to its completion.\n\nThe CMPCS President reserved special praise for the Management Committee that supervised the project and the contractors for making judicious use of the money appropriated for the project.\n\nThe newly commissioned PTI CMPCS edifice has six rooms, two large stores for storage of goods, one showroom store, a reception room, one conference room and a big office space for committee members, one Security/Drivers apartment and a generator house amongst others.\n\n# Retirement Jarikre, Adoghe, Others Retire\n\nUdemezue Onyinyechi\n\nMr. Charles Obaruara Jarikre, Deputy Director (Training), Petroleum Marketing and Business Studies (PMBS) Department has bowed out of the Public Services on attainment of 60 years mandatory retirement age.

Can you tell us about yourself, educational background and achievements up till your appointment as Director of Research & Development?\n\nMy name is Oyetunde, Bamidele Sunday. I attended Christ's School, Ado-Ekiti; I later proceeded to University of Ile-Ife, now known as Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, where I had a degree in Mathematics, second class upper in 1987. I obtained\n\nPostgraduate Diploma in\n\nComputer Science in 1995 from University of Benin. I equally had Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1998 and M.Sc. in\n\nMathematics in 2003 from\n\nUniversity of Benin respectively, and a Doctorate degree in\n\nMathematics in 2007, also from the University of Benin.\n\nI belong to various Professional Bodies, such as Member, Nigeria Mathematical Society (NMS), American Mathematical Society (AMS), Mathematical Association of\n\nNigeria (MAN), Nigeria\n\nAssociation of Mathematical\n\nPhysics (NAMP); and Southern African Mathematical Science\n\nAssociation (SAMSA). Also, I am a Member, Nigeria Computer\n\nSociety (NCS), Computer\n\nProfessionals of Nigeria (CPN), Information Technology\n\nAssociation of Nigeria (ITAN),\n\nSociety of Petroleum Engineers (SPE), among others.\n\nThe pursuit of my academic work took me to some countries such as South Africa to attend a programme on mathematical\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/1197d0218680ff642bbd3cc1585303d184f940a1e75595633baa243e1b2864c5.jpg)\n\nshould aspire to have Doctorate degree which will enable them to know more because with my experience, if I have not gone for Ph.D. in Mathematics, I wouldn't have known the application of Mathematics in Oceanography, Submarine activity, Shipping etc. Staff need to be encouraged to pursue Doctorate programmes for those who have acquired Masters and those who have just first degree should go for Masters.\n\nbiology. I also did some research work in University of Waterloo, Canada, where I worked in their Applied Mathematics Department for some months. I also worked briefly in research laboratory of the Institute of Oceanography, University of Delaware, Newark, USA, for some months before coming back to Nigeria.\n\nI have been teaching Mathematics and Statistics for some time in PTI but now I am concentrating only in Mathematics courses. I was given the best PTI Lecturer award in 2005. I was also awarded the Chief Philip Asiodu Prize as the best student in the Masters of Business Administration 1995 in the Entrance Examination into the University of Benin.\n\nResearch is one of the bedrock of PTI Mission, what are your plans to rejig Research and Development?\n\nResearch and Development is a new Directorate that we are just building up. Be that as it may, to rejig the Directorate, we are going to improve on the research culture among Staff and Students. There is need for our Staff to have that culture of research activities and this we have started through the formation of cluster groups, research teams and student postal presentation (for final year students). We will also improve on research capability of Academic Staff through Staff training. I observe that most of our staff, after first degree, a few of them are just having Masters, they\n\nIn summary, with “all the necessary support in place, I am determined to take the directorate to its zenith and make it a world-class.\n\nTalking about funding, without funds you cannot do much. We are going to source for funds both locally and internationally to maximize our research output through products development. We are going to commercialize some of our products and publish some of our research works in reputable journals. We are also going to patent some of them to ensure that the important ones are documented. We are going to develop the research activities that will address the challenges in the oil and gas sector, and thinking of collaborating with R&D centers both in Nigeria and outside Nigeria so as to move faster.\n\nWe are also nursing the idea of getting a dedicated Research Laboratory to improve on our research works. Also, we will grow the number of research groups in the Institute, presently there are about ten. We intend to increase research activities as obtainable in other institutions and also encourage the full participation of\n\n“In all, we are doing our best though, we are not where we hope to be yet but we are definitely not where we used to be in terms of research”. “Academic Staff. “In summary, with all the necessary support in place, I am determined to take the directorate to its zenith and make it a world-class”.\n\n# As a renowned Mathematician, do you see your new role as a daunting task?\n\nWell, I don't see it as that. A Mathematician is noted for analytical skills and analytical thinking, so most of the problems in Engineering and Sciences are solved through mathematical models.\n\nSo, as an applied Mathematician, I am exposed to various areas of the oil and gas exploration, statistics, data analysis, probability, distribution, exploration, horizontal drilling, etc. In the Petroleum Engineering, you do a lot of computer work and a lot of simulation that helps even in the prediction of risk analysis of the oil well, even in transportation through pipelines. ${\\\\mathsf{S}}0,$ in a nutshell, Mathematics and\n\nResearch are basically the same. I feel at home here.\n\nAs you assume mantle of leadership in the Directorate of Research and Development, what innovations do you intend to put in place to move the Directorate forward viz-a-viz the Institute, in the areas of breakthrough research; will there be a paradigm shift from your predecessors?\n\nPart of my innovations are partnership and collaboration. You cannot do many of these things in isolation. We are thinking of partnering with other organizations. Staff motivation is another aspect, because if the staff are not motivated they won't be interested in research work and this will be done through Staff training. We will continue to talk to the Management about the Staff training.\n\nAnother strategy is Staff exchange. We should be able to exchange some of our staff with other Organisations in order to learn. Our Staff should be able to go on sabbatical if it can be embedded in our conditions of service as it is applicable to Universities. If our Staff have gone for Doctorate programmes, on completion they should be given a year sabbatical and postdoctoral fellowship. After the sabbatical the Staff should be able to come back and tell the Management what he or she has achieved.\n\nWe are also going to encourage Staff to pursue PostDoctorate programmes. Again, we will look at the work load of Academic Staff. I can tell you authoritatively that the Academic Staff are having excess workload. We will find a way to reduce it to enable them devote part of their time to research work.\n\nAgain, we are going to source for funds. The Directorate is just emerging and as a result, it requires a lot funds to carry out its functions. We may approach Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for assistance. Like what is obtainable in other schools, PTI does not benefit from TETFUND. Once we have adequate funding, training and certification and a lot other things will follow.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/4f7084b8ac8268181beae4a2e46ed8c78ceb9cb2450ae63206e8180cdcf8a26d.jpg)\n\nSpeaking about paradigm shift, I want to build on what my predecessors have done. I will not say there will be total paradigm shift, I have to build on what I met on ground.\n\nThe Federal Government recently charged the Institute on groundbreaking research in modular refinery, gas flaring etc., how and when will you set the ball\n\nModular refinery, gas flaring, these are some of the common terminologies we do encounter on a daily basis. Crude oil refining, especially in simply compact unit is referred to as modular refinery.\n\nend gas flaring for some time now but another deadline is 2020 which is not realizable. Nigeria is the sixth largest gas flaring country in the world and second in Africa after Algeria.\n\nWell, with our Environmental Research team, we will see whatever we can do to partner and ensure we put an end to gas flaring. We are just starting and I can assure you that soon, we will bedeviling research in the oil and gas sector are local raw material substitution, the drilling fluid, oil spill, locally formulated lubricant among others. Manufacturing of Modular refinery for research work is what our team from PNGPD is working on currently. Reservoir and drilling engineering is another aspect of research we are working on. Those are some of the areas we have core issues. We need a lot of research activities to enable us assist the oil and gas Industry. We are also developing software that will solve some problems in the oil and gas Industry. Our team on Safety and Environment, Gas flaring and Climate are doing their best in conventional one, it can be moved from one location to another. Some of the importance are to promote peace in the Niger Delta, which is to create jobs for the youth, to complement the supply of petroleum products. Gas flaring is one of the major problems in the world, it consumes the useful waste, natural resources and produces harmful waste and the harmful waste have negative impact on the society such as cancer of the lungs among others. With our activities in the Environmental Research team, we are doing something about it. The Federal Government has said they will\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/a039cd776c03d8df4f4e6f4ce2239131afe83a6a095bd90ab3bc021dd695d101.jpg)\n\ncome out with a blue print.\n\nPTI is set up to develop Human Capital and carry out Research for the oil sector, in realization of this mandate, have you conducted a needs analysis of some major oil companies and to carry out a corresponding research that will address identified problems?\n\nAs I said, I am building on what my predecessors have done. Before I came on board, the Directorate have written to collaborate with sister agencies such as NCDMB, PTDF, NNPC, DPR, some are yet to respond but some have responded. But most of the challenges currently\n\nthis regard. “In all, we are doing our best though, we are not where we hope to be yet but we are definitely not where we used to be in terms of research”.\n\nDo you really think that this collaboration will take care of needs analysis of the companies, and do you believe that these research proposals will attract research grants from these companies?\n\nWell, it depends. If for instance the NCDMB is having R&D Unit, we expect that there should be a level of collaboration instead of duplication of activities. Though we have observed that most of the sister agencies have been excluding PTI from their\n\nactivities but we are doing all we can to get this corrected. If collaboration issue is settled with agencies, it would aid us in knowing more about their needs and how to tackle them. I believe collaboration will take care of the needs of the companies.\n\nIt was reported in the press that most developed countries would phase out automobiles using gasoline by 2040, which would drastically reduce demand for crude oil in international market, as part of your long term goal, what adaptive research in areas of alternative energy sources (Renewable Energy) are you looking at?\n\nI do believe that the demand for crude oil may reduce but not completely. Vehicles across the globe ride on gasoline. Besides gasoline, there are other products that are associated with crude oil and that is why we cannot rule it out. The plastic industry make use of crude oil, asphalt bitumen which contribute about $3%,$ so gasoline is $44%$ of the extraction, the aviation fuel used for airplane and other aircraft contribute about $8%,$ so we are just focusing more on gasoline to drive our vehicle without looking at the usage of other crude. Lubricants, grease, residual fuel we cannot do away with them but we always talk about gasoline being phased out.\n\nThe alternative sources of energy we are advocating is wave and tidal energy. The wave has an advantage over the tidal energy. In wave energy, you can construct and put in any location in the ocean, it is transferrable but very expensive, while wind energy or biomass energy (burning of wood) but here we are doing more of biomass fuel, using live plants to convert to energy, but the argument now is when there are not enough for people to consume, how do we augment?. Now, other plants which are not consumable that can be used to convert to energy are discovered. But don't forget that, if we are talking of wave energy, you have Come what “may, crude oil will still be relevant in the future. “to be close to the ocean, even hydro power, unless the source of the hydro is there, then nuclear power but if anything goes wrong, the effect is catastrophe. I know we have Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NNRA) to handle that but I must tell you that it is still farfetched when it comes to alternative energy across the globe.\n\nCome what may, crude oil will still be relevant in the future. Like some of the energy, the\n\nequipment used to extract the energy still emit gas, only to discover you are spending more. In the bid to solve a problem, you end up creating more problems.\n\nResearch and Development require huge capital outlay; what budget is allocated to R&D in the Institute and what do you think should be the realistic budget for the R&D to perform optimally? And to be frank sir, do you think that this budget is realistic? And if we want to leave a legacy in PTI, what should be the realistic budget to keep the Directorate afloat?\n\nFor now, we do not have a dedicated budget for R&D but we have budget for training. So if we want to spend, the Institute will look at the budget for training and disburse to us. However, we are making sure that the R&D is embedded in the Institute's budget. To be modest, I will say 20 million Naira as a start-off budget will be ideal. This is to encourage our researchers and as time goes on when we start building research laboratories and do other things, the budget will go up reasonably. The Chief Executive has been emphasizing on the need for us to write proposals to attract funding.\n\nIs there a way the Staff have been trained on how to write Research Proposals?\n\nYes. To be precise, last year we organized a two-day Research Proposal Writing seminar for all Academic Staff at the PTI Conference Centre Complex. It was a huge success and we are still going to revisit it soon.\n\nWhat challenges do you envisage that may hinder you from realizing your goals?\n\nAs we have been saying, poor funding and Staff training. The funding will encourage Staff. If there is money, we will be able to do things and also account for what the monies were used for.\n\nCan you tell us the most challenging project(s) you have worked on? What challenges are you looking at in this new role as Research Director? In your opinion, which is a better approach: working quickly to develop a good solution or taking more time to craft an excellent solution?\n\nThe most challenging project I have embarked upon was when I was the coordinator in Computer Centre in 2001. We were mandated to train DPR Staff on ICT and ICT then was just evolving. The training took almost a year in 2001 and the intermediate took another one year in 2002/2003, as most of the DPR Staff were grouped and we were going there to teach them, besides my teaching job. It was a serious challenge then because internet facilities were just coming up coupled with poor funding.\n\nAnother arduous challenge was the migration of the Institute to online platform in 2011 under Mrs. Dennar regime. It was a serious challenge. Before then, most of our application and registration were manually done but she gave the directive that it must be online. So to get the platform with the collaboration of other Staff was a very serious challenge and up till now there are still some challenges as per the software that will compute the result as well as transcript.\n\nTo me, working quickly but together to develop a good solution is better because a teamwork will always proffer a good solution.\n\nWhat welfare packages do you plan for Staff in your Directorate who desire to pursue a career or certificate courses?\n\nOne of the welfare packages is sponsorship for training programmes. As many of them that are interested in training programmes should be encouraged. Over the years some of us have benefitted from the same system, so they too should benefit. If you are trained, you will not remain the same. All it requires is just a little push.\n\nAnother welfare package is the creation of an enabling environment, good office accommodation for Staff. A situation whereby four Staff are packed in a room is very discouraging, they would not have time to concentrate and give their best. I must commend the effort of the Institute's Management for stabilizing our electricity and the ongoing renovations in the Institute.\n\nAssuming a new office in any organization is known to be somewhat challenging especially in areas of hostility\n\namong staff. What strategies do you propose to adopt in\n\norder to foster a harmonious working environment to boost work efficiency and\n\nproductivity?\n\nFirst and foremost, all workers should be treated with dignity and respect no matter the level of the staff. No worker should be subjected to harassment either through religious belief, political or ethnic affiliation, all workers should be treated equally. Thank God PTI is a like a mini Nigeria, we have people from all geopolitical zones, no staff should be underrated. Always acknowledge little things, sparse achievements of staff should be encouraged. It is always good to say “thank you” if somebody has done something for you because it will go a long way to encourage the staff to do more.\n\nAlso, as a leader you should avoid idle gossiping and also encourage team spirit among staff and they should not do things in isolation. I should be able to offer help to my subordinates and colleague when they are in need and share in their pain. Render help to them and not intimidate them. Run an open door policy. If they have complain, they should come to me to express their minds and we should also be able to socialize outside as no man is an island.\n\n# How do you relax?\n\nI love watching African Magic Yoruba, news channels such as TVC, NTA etc. Occasionally, I do visit the Staff Club for relaxation.\n\n# Prove Your Worth , PCE Charges New Staff\n\nLucky Akaighe\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/905229b9450ea3e41ef646f265ba2769582c8d189818a93eb2e21098d52c3d7f.jpg)\n\nFront row : The PCE, Prof. S.E.

The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry. As you peruse through the training brochure,\n\n# PTI Leading in Hightech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector\n\nwe have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company. At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.\n\nPTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.\n\nDr. Henry A.

Additionally, it brings to a halt the total waste of the flared gas resource and replaces same with monetization of the flared gas value in a commercial term that ultimately will provide financial dividends to both the Institute and the primary gas asset partners, on one hand and the potential downstream off-taker partners on the other.\n\nThe strategic game-changer in all of this is the fact that the Institute’s Graduates will have an unrivaled study environment to propel their grit and hold on the right skill set needed for a sustainable development of the Oil and Gas industry.\n\n# The PTI International Convention and Exposition Centre.\n\nObjective: In order to fill the void of a suitable convention and exhibition infrastructure in the entire breath of the oil industry operation area and the growing desire of the oil and gas industry to positively remain in touch with global best industrial practices by advancing and expanding the potentials of the Nigerian oil and gas industry through myriads of oil and gas conventions and expositions, it is imperative for the industry to enjoy a befitting bestin- kind infrastructure of such magnitude to attract vibrant, needed international oil and gas players and other participants.\n\nAction Plan: A befitting and deliberately intended facility of such nature hosted by the PTI will provide the needed ability to fill the void above and etch the institute in the core of the industry’s operations and processes in a much more defining manner of sustainability.\n\nThe proposed infrastructure in order to meet the target of a best –in –kind facility must aim at the highest international standards while uniquely inter -web with the local, socio-cultural dynamics of both the industry and the host community and serve the greatest utility of national interest.\n\nThe complex, which shall be a smart complex should boast of the following; a magnificent convention and exposition pavilion ground floor, a shopping complex/ business floor, multi-level basement parking, hospitality support, utility towers to serve for syndicate rooms and office space for the institute, multi-level rental spaces for oil and gas operators as offices and potential space for tertiary health care /diagnosis centre with ancillary utilities support (electrical, mechanical, etc.)\n\nThe convention centre is proposed to be largest multipurpose conference centre in Nigeria with a maximum floor space of 15000sqm. The facility will provide a 5000-dinner and conference event capacity, 500 exhibition booths and concert with audiences of up to 10,000 people. The hall will be a large single open facility, capable of flexible movable partitions into, up to 10 halls, and will have 10 built-in smaller conference rooms, 50 staff offices tower building and 3000sqm let-able spaces to accommodate banks, supermarkets and shops in the pavilion. The prestigious convention centre will have a three-tower rising above the convention pavilion to house all service functions described above and a 5-star luxury hotel with 400 rooms, 6 international restaurants, gymnasium, outdoor garden, swimming pool, salon and spa, business centre and a 1200-car parking space.\n\nProspects: An infrastructure of this nature when delivered shall provide the institute an unparalleled visibility and acceptance which will undoubtedly promote business with the institute and earn tremendous amounts of revenue for the institute and potential investors. Potential enhancement of this project significance lies in the on-going and upcoming massive infrastructural developments, particularly in transportation and energy envisaged in the Niger Delta region such as the Warri deep sea port, the nodal network of rail in the Warri corridor (Lagos-Calabar rail line, Warri-Abuja rail line), the existing airport facility around which the Institute enjoys availability of large expanse of land and the potential massive surge of stable energy seeking industrial spin-offs, at the behest of the anticipated phenomenal infrastructure growth within the Niger Delta Region are strong promoting indicators for viability of the project.\n\n# Proposed Flagship Event:\n\nFocus on: Africa Energy Agenda\n\nPromoters: This can be co-promoted by a combination of OPEC, APO, AfDB and AfCTA, NNPC, NIPC, MPR and themes focused around;\n\n\\\\* Evolving Africa Energy Ecosystem and Driving Development of the New Global Business and Growth Frontier\n\n$^\\*$ The Africa Energy Business Solution in the Global Marketplace\n\n\\\\* Setting the African Energy Agenda for Economic Growth and Sustainable Development\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/ca96b0a90ea1ff8d741ce3bb118dd03ef63ebc979531da0b64576e22276cd77f.jpg)\n\nGlobal Energy Technology and Investment Expo for Africa\n\n# Themes\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/930e59ad6f3f4611a17d6af574585dc15ba89c13307e0f4ee3423767afe553dd.jpg)\n\n# PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/5644cef28a617ce78c82ffaadfcab890f420df614469fe7b6b598e7d4b5ac3da.jpg)\n\nof Excellence $\\\\textcircled{\\\\div}$ $\\\\textcircled{\\\\div}$\n\n# Modular Refinery\n\n(Condensate)(OJT Facility)\n\nObjective: Nigeria is one of the largest crude oil producers in Africa with recorded crude oil production of 1,776,000 barrels/day as at January 2020. However, almost all the fuel products consumed in the country are imported due to inadequate refining facilities. In 2018, Nigeria imported 4.37 billion litres of PMS, 872.72million litres of AGO (diesel oil), and 312.71million litres of household kerosene according to National Bureau of Statistics. This is indeed a very disturbing situation for a country with a population of about 200 million people and already battling with high rate of unemployment.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/a933d378826c45f14696bcba58b9a9a859a2c210c6693edfdb4be7ed574ad9de.jpg)\n\n[https://images.app.goo.gl/xcvNJPgypnH8kKNG9](https://images.app.goo.gl/xcvNJPgypnH8kKNG9)\n\nThe ministry of petroleum resources in an effort to address this problem with the 7BIG WINS agenda, under which short and long terms plans were developed to increase the local refining capacity and gradually attain self-sufficiency in terms of petroleum fuel products supply, aimed at ensuring amongst others; to review, optimize and promote the development of modular refineries in Nigeria.\n\nThis led to the Petroleum Training Institute being in the fore front in the area of training and technological development spear heading this work of developing an indigenous technology for modular refinery in Nigeria to serve as both an OJT facility and revenue generation initiative.\n\n# Action Plan:\n\nNigeria produces about 2 million barrels of crude oil per day, exports all and import refined products, hence the urgency of the need to evolve practical home grown solutions such as the development and deployment of home grown designed modular refineries by the PTI as a panacea to the energy security crisis. The scope of action is scheduled for a 24 month design, procurement process, fabrication/erection/ construction and commissioning of a prototype design and a 500 barrel scale up modular refinery.\n\nProspects: As conceived, the modular refinery when completed will present the industry with an outstanding world-class training facility in the West African sub –region, with the compelling attraction for expertise training and know-how in refining and petrochemical operations and therefore promoting PTI as a hub of OJT and also attracting business interests from operators, contractors, consultancy requisite for oil and gas production outfits.\n\n# Dive Centre of Excellence\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/a531b7b1c28dec0d9e11d7d16fb2c40a6dc302dc3d9028a888fbeae6153ec53e.jpg)\n\nObjective: Being a critical asset to the institute, the diving centre as conceived is a priority PPP project in order to guarantee its long term sustainability, increase revenue generation and value addition.

The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry. As you peruse through the training brochure,\n\n# PTI Leading in Hightech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector\n\nwe have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company. At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.\n\nPTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.\n\n# Dr. Samuel E.

Dr. Samuel E. Onoji Principaland ChiefExecutive \n\nurl: https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Amb-Ella.pdf \n content: # Amb. Ella Seeks for Consolidation of PTI Mandate\n\nThe Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR), Amb. Nicholas Agbo Ella has called for a consolidation of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) mandate, adding that the foremost Oil and Gas Institute in Africa has all it takes to train and retrain the required personnel in the sector.\n\nSpeaking over the weekend in Effurun while on a working visit to the Institute, the MPR Permanent Secretary said, “We must consolidate on achieving the full potential in the Institute instead of creating another petroleum institute. I feel very proud that we have an Institute like this. I have said it earlier and I will reiterate that, we cannot have Petroleum Training Institute of this magnitude in Nigeria and fail to utilize it”.\n\nWhile lamenting the huge loss of revenue incurred on foreign training, Amb. Ella stated that, “Training is essential for all of us as individuals and as an organization. We should be able to develop ourselves and our capacities as well as enhance our productivities. PTI has all it takes to train all oil workers in Nigeria and I don’t see why we cannot train locally in PTI and save our scarce resources”.\n\nSpeaking further, he opined that, “I have told our colleagues in the sector that we must patronize the Petroleum Training Institute. At the Ministry level, we will push up the level of collaboration we desire. This is achievable if we unite and work as a team. We will speak with GMD of Nigeria National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) and other sister agencies in the Ministry. PTI need to move beyond where it is presently. This is the only Petroleum Training Institute we have in the country and we will not allow it to fail in discharging its responsibility”.\n\nIt would be recalled that there was a recent move by the current National Assembly to establish another Petroleum Training Institute in Ibeno, Akwa Ibom State. The MPR Permanent Secretary stated that there is no need for it. He declared that” We should rather channel the resources to PTI Effurun and turn it around, so that it can perform better”. He further stated that “We don’t need to establish any other institution of this nature in Nigeria. We should work harder to enhance what we have here by improving the capacity of the personnel”.\n\nHe suggested that, “If people find it difficult to come down to Effurun for the training, we can actually conduct the training at the Public Service Institute in Abuja under the umbrella of PTI. PTI Certification is recognized globally, so why will I go and train my personnels in a lesser institution outside the country when we have a better and well-equipped organization that can handle such trainings locally with just a little resource. Let’s work together to give maximum cooperation to the Management of PTI”.\n\nSpeaking on the purpose of his visit to the Institute, the Permanent Secretary said, “My main visit today is firstly to encourage the acting Principal Chief Executive, Engr. Dr. Samuel E. Onoji and the entire members of staff to pursue professionalism, because, with that, they will be able to be on top of their game in the development of the oil and gas industry.\n\n“Secondly, I am here to encourage the Institute Management, to create room for inclusion in other programs of studies outside what they are currently doing. The energy sector is your primary domain, we want you to push harder to develop other competencies”.\n\n“The Institute as you are all aware is the heart of research for the oil and gas sector of the economy. PTI is a reputed citadel of all technological knowledge and we will continue to give it all the necessary support it deserves. I want to assure you today that the two Ministers of State Petroleum Resources (Oil) and (Gas) have shown great interest and commitment in the repositioning of PTI and I sincerely call on all Nigerians especially, the policy makers to look inward to harness the potential of the Institute”.\n\nOn lack of patronage of sister agencies, he promised to continue to engage the President and other stakeholders on the issue adding, “We will continue to give you all the necessary support. The facilities of the Institute are delipidating, we will continue to engage. We will explore all options going forward, we will find a way to attract international support for the Institute”. While commending the Institute Management for what they have done over the years, he prayed for a well-positioned Institute. In his word, “We look forward to seeing a better PTI in the coming years.\n\n“We will continue to lobby the National Assemble for adequate funding for the Institute. There is need to fund the petroleum industry, we are looking for a way to draw international attention. I am currently championing the establishment of African Energy Bank, when this is achieved, it will enhance our work in research & development and investment in the oil and gas industry”, he disclosed. \n\nurl: https://portal.pti.edu.ng/StudentLogin.aspx \n content: ![](https://portal.pti.edu.ng/images/PTINOW.jpg)\n\n# Student Login\n\nLogin With Your Details\n\nMatric No \\*\n\nPassword \\*\n\nUSEFUL INFORMATION\n\nPLEASE NOTE: PAYMENT OF FEES IS NOW DONE AFTER GENERATING RRR CODE ONLY ON THE INSTITUTE PORTAL (www.pti.edu.ng).\n\nPAY ONLINE OR TAKE THE PRINT-OUT OF THE RRR CODE TO ANY BANK FOR PAYMENT.\n\nIf you have an existing account and you can't logon, you can click here to find a solution FAQS\n\n#### Useful Links\n\n**[Home](http://portal.pti.edu.ng/)**\n\n**[Applicant Login](https://portal.pti.edu.ng/ApplicantLogin.aspx)**\n\n**[Applicant SignUP](https://portal.pti.edu.ng/ApplicantsSignOn.aspx)**\n\n**[REQUERRY REMITA PAYMENT](https://portal.pti.edu.ng/RequeryRemitaPayment.aspx)** \n\nurl: https://pti.edu.ng/2020/08/08/post-utme-now-to-hold-online/ \n content: Back\n\n## Uncategorized\n\nThis is to inform all candidates that the post UTME screening exercise for 2020/2021 Academic Session has been rescheduled as follows:\n\n* * *\n\n**Date: Saturday, 19th September, 2020.**\n\n**Time: 2.00pm – 5.00pm.**\n\n“Supplementary examinations to be scheduled on the 1st of December only for those that may have missed out on the first schedule as a result of their involvement with WAEC and NECO examinations.

The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil $&$ gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry.\n\nAs you peruse through the training brochure, we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company.\n\nAt PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.\n\nPTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.\n\nDr. Henry A.

Isichei\n\nDirector of Research & Development\n\nDr. Tina Isichei graduated as one of the best in her class before her 19th birthday with a B.Sc Industrial Chemistry from the University of Benin in 1986. She later went back to her alma mater for her M.Sc. in Industrial Chemistry (1999) and later a Ph.D. in Environmental/ Analytical Chemistry (2012).\n\nShe started her career with the Savannah Sugar Company Limited in Numan, Adamawa State in 1986 as a youth corps member, and later worked as a Laboratory Technologist till 1992 when she voluntarily resigned her appointment and joined the services of the Petroleum Training Institute.\n\nAt PTI, she spent her first year at the Petroleum Analysis Laboratory, before moving to the General Studies Department where she taught Foundational Chemistry. She was later posted to the Industrial Safety & Environmental Technology Department where she taught courses in Environmental Chemistry for several years. Her last posting as a teaching staff was to the Science Laboratory Technology Department as one of the pioneer staff.\n\nHer PhD thesis was on product development from the Water hyacinth — a perennial weed constituting a nuisance and hazard in many parts of Nigeria, especially the Niger Delta area, and across the globe. She is a firm advocate for the circular economy — passionate about developing products from waste materials as she believes that every waste material has an intrinsic value. As an academic, she has published papers in national and international journals and has attended and presented papers in local and international conferences. She is also a reviewer for many international journals.\n\nHer contributions and roles in the institute include E- learning Coordinator, pioneer member of the QMS team that drafted the Institute’s quality policy, leader of the research team on Raw Materials and Production chemicals for the petroleum industry among others. She recently led the team that delivered the PTI anthem to the institute. She has grown through the ranks in the Institute and was recently promoted/appointed as the Director of Science.\n\nDr Isichei is a highly sought-after speaker within and outside the Institute and in   professional and religious circles. She is a Fellow of the Chemical Society of Nigeria (CSN) and Institute of Chartered Chemists of Nigeria (ICCON), Member of American Chemical Society (ACS), Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and Nigerian Environmental Society (NES). Dr Isichei is happily married with children and is passionate about mentoring teenagers, youths and women to maximize their full potentials.\n\n### Other Members\n\n![DoS](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DoS-200x200.jpg)\n\n#### [Dr. Olowoyo David Niyi](https://pti.edu.ng/our_team/dr-olowoyo-david-niyi/)\n\nDirector of Science\n\n![Otec](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Otec-200x200.png)\n\n#### [Engr.

It can also create doctrines that may not be healthy for the society.Anger is an outward expression ofbottled-up offence of an inbuilt emotion,whichreacts to all forms of impulses of negative or positive emotion.Thoughts and feelings that can be stirred up by provocative words, and actions, inform of criticism, oppression, false accusation,gossip,betrayal,disobedi ence, disloyalty, and sometimes corruption.\n\nBy Onyinyechi Udemezue\n\nAnger does not really have an explicit Definition and the symptoms may not be ascertained because, one man's boiling point, may be the freezing point of another man. However, anger is a vice that incubates other destructive vices. The spirit of angeristhedemonickeysthatbreak the hedge of protection. Even the Holy Scripture says, \"Be ye angry and sin not\".(Eph.4:26) and he that break the hedge a serpent shall bit.

It is an involuntary emotional reaction.Mosttimeswe considered anger as a normal reaction to“miscon ception about one's personality when all efforts to set the records straight to another person, seems abortive\". Anger may not be totally a bad habit, but it may result in evil and destruction of life and property if not managed.\n\nAngermaylead touncontrollable action, and the consequences could be destructive. The devil is still using the subtle device of anger to destroy families, churches, different organisations and the world in general today.\n\nThis article is geared towards the negative impact of anger in our homes, work place and even the society at large. Anger, when out of control negatively breed resentfulness, bitterness, hostility, enmity and destruction of lives and properties.

As the name implies, it is geared towards making people working in the industries continue their education without breaking off from their jobs in the industry.\n\nThe programme came into existence due to the yearnings of the Oil, Gas and Allied Industries in Warri and its environs, to upgrade the capacity of their middle cadre manpower without disturbing their production.\n\nHitherto, most of the workers upgraded their technical knowledge through day releases from their companies or by shuttling. Day releases were at the expense of the Industry. Shuttling causes questionable practices at the workplace and in PTI.\n\nAs years went by, the SICE programmes stabilized in PTI and it metamorphosed to weekend programme to cater for students from far and wide.\n\nThe SICE programme has continuously and successfully run for  over twenty five years ( 1995-till date).  Many oil/gas and allied industries workers have benefited from the programme.\n\n- [Objectives of the SICE Programme](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1471191075767-71032b6f-42fe)\n- [Admission Requirements](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1471191075781-f8bcfdd3-4be6)\n- [Certificates Awarded](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1471191079146-bea36456-c6e5)\n- [Teaching Staff for the SICE](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1621659871991-ffe03e98-5f23)\n- [Programmes Available](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1621790130329-2c4c9f83-3795)\n- [Contact Us](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/#1633713730095-0c3a9825-c214)\n\n#### [Objectives of the SICE Programme](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/\\#1471191075767-71032b6f-42fe)\n\nThe objectives of the SICE programme are in line with the PTI mission and vision and these are as follows:\n\n1\\.

In terms of operation the up stream ector is arranged af follows:\n\nJoint Venture: This is the standard agreement between the national oil company i.e the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and an international oil company (IOC).\n\nProduction Sharing Contracts: NNPC engages the IOC or the indigenous company as Contractor to conduct petroleum operations on behalf of itself and NNPC. The Contractor takes on the financing risk.\n\nService Contract: Under this model, the Contractor undertakes exploration, development and production activities for, and on behalf of, NNPC or the concession holder, at its own risk. Concession ownership remains entirely with the NNPC/holder, and the Contractor has no title to the oil produced.\n\nMarginal Field Concession: The Federal Government (FG), in furtherance of its Nigerian Content agenda, encourages IOCs to surrender their marginal fields for\n\n# Overview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry- Downstream Sector\n\nTransmission and Conveyance: This involves the transportation of oil and gas to the refinery and gas stations.\n\nRefining: Nigeria has four refineries: two situated in Port Harcourt and one each in Warri and Kaduna.\n\nDistribution and Marketing: Distribution and Marketing of refined petroleum products are complementary activities. Distribution involves the transportation of refined petroleum products from the refineries through pipelines, coastal vessels, road trucks, rail wagon etc to the storage/sale depots.\n\nPetroleum products are supplied in Nigeria principally through the Petroleum Product Marketing Company’s (PPMC) pipeline system, which links the refineries to the about 21 regional storage/sale depots.\n\nLiquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Nigeria holds the largest natural gas reserves in Africa but has limited infrastructure in place to develop the sector. Nigeria’s first and most ambitious gas project, the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) facility on Bonny Island has six LNG trains currently operational with a total annual capacity of 31bcmIt has become an\n\nOverview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry- Oil Service Sector The classification of services under this sector is summarized as follows:\n\nSeismic data acquisition Processing and interpretation logging, fishing, cementing welding services\n\n# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry\n\nThe oil and gas industry is a complex and fascinating one. Its work sites are unique and few people have the privilege of viewing them up close.\n\nThere are three fundamental tasks in the industry: exploration (seismic operation); drilling and construction; and production, processing and offloading.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/42bd2bec-4fd4-4c2f-bae1-4cdb36151f11/images/11efc8352f15c4a72994bd997a3dd41a4f97454fde9280e5aa60a93446c36d02.jpg)\n\n# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry--Drilling\n\nDrilling: Once the geologist through seismic operations confirms the presence of hydrocarbon in an area (land or water), the designated spot is marked for drilling. Drilling an oil well is a massive project that involves teams of workers and specialists.\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/42bd2bec-4fd4-4c2f-bae1-4cdb36151f11/images/2d9925a912f4176848cf2e43e0d0aaeb78980f7d51c592a91138c0ee4055953e.jpg)\n\n# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry- Production &Processing\n\nProduction is the extraction step: getting the oil or gas out of the ground and off the premises into a pipeline or cryogenic tank. In the early stages of production, the oil or gas (sometimes both) might flow of their own accord, but eventually engineers will have to coax it out—if injecting steam or gas under pressure can be called coaxing. Processing is the stage where the hydrocarbon mix goes through a number of processes to separate the various hydrocarbon fractions (roughly, gas from condensate from oils) and all from water. The processes take the fluid mixture—often at high temperature and pressure—through heat exchangers, valves, compressors and similar devices which deliver the separated components to different storage and offloading facilities.\n\n# Relevance of Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Worker\n\nThe oil and gas industry is one of the most lucrative fields for employment.\n\nWorkers in this field of business generally receive sizeable salaries and numerous benefits, while at the same time enjoying frequent travel to distant locations and intellectually stimulating work.\n\nHowever, while it is true that working in the oil and gas industry does offer numerous benefits, it’s important to remember that there are also many risks that come with a job in this field.\n\nBecause of these risks to health and safety, it becomes imperative for businesses to prepare their employees for the rigours of a job in the oil and gas industry.\n\nJob description in the oil and gas industry are always evolving, as new technology and environmental regulation change the face of the industry and make having an educated and well-trained staff an industry imperative.\n\nEducation and training shouldn't end when the person is hired, however. Nothing stays static, and in today's ever-changing energy environment that is more the case than ever.\n\n# Relevance of Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Worker\n\nEffective training – i.e., by experienced energy professionals – can have a wideranging impact on the individual being trained, the company he or she works for, and the industry as a whole.\n\nFor individual employees, continuing to learn and develop their professional skills and expand their knowledge-base can open up opportunities for advancement in their companies.\n\nStaying on top of best practices and growing on the job can insure that an employee will remain valuable to his or her employer.\n\nProductive employees are any company's biggest asset, and when they leave, they take with them years of experience, knowledge and skill. It doesn't matter what the economy is like or what is happening in the industry, retaining the best performers is essential for the success of a company. Keeping them motivated is a key factor in that.\n\nInvesting in employees by providing them with opportunities to improve their skill level shows them their contributions are valued. That kind of investment in human capital will pay back in increased productiveness and a solid bottom line. Finally, a welltrained workforce contributes mightily to the entire industry, whose successes and failures can have a worldwide impact.\n\n# Regulatory Framework Enhancing Local Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Industry\n\nIn the past, training and skill acquisition for industrial workers are hardly within the contemplation of investors and government.\n\nRecently, there has been a rethink of the objectives of the investors and government actors in the industry, because of the spate of increase in industrial accidents resulting to impacts on humans and environment.\n\nIt is obvious that without sound national policies and management strategies, the Nation’s increasing scale of economic activity in coming decades and beyond would pose serious challenges for the Oil and Gas sector.\n\nThe basis of any law or regulation in Nigeria is contained in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Pursuant to section 20 of the Constitution, the State is empowered to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the water, air and land, forest and wildlife of Nigeria.\n\n# The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010 No. 2\n\nThe Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NOGICD 2010 Act) is an attempt by the government and stakeholders in the petroleum industry to ensure that the industry provides local value and maximized benefits to Nigerians.\n\nSpecifically, the ―Act‖ as addresses issues pertaining to: Employment; Social development; Security; Local currency; Encouragement of local and foreign investment; Promotion and Protection of local businesses/investments\n\nOrganize conferences, workshops, seminars, symposia, trainings, road shows and other public education fora to further the attainment of the goal of Patronage of local resources: human and material; Discouraging imports and encouraging exports.\n\nConduct studies, researches and investigations that may further the attainment of the goal of developing Nigerian content in the Nigerian oil and gas industry; Nigerian Content Division (NCD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)\n\nIn 2005, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) established the Nigerian Content Division (NCD) policy to give a formal structure to Nigerian Content issues and significantly positioned the policy for more holistic application in the industry.\n\n# The Thrust of the Nigerian Content Policy\n\nThe Nigerian Content Policy seeks to promote a framework that guarantees active participation of Nigerians in oil and gas activities without compromising standards.\n\nThe policy also focuses on the promotion of value addition in Nigeria through the utilization of local raw materials, products and services in order to stimulate growth of indigenous capacity.\n\nThe Federal Government is optimistic that its policy will result in steady measurable and sustainable growth of Nigerian Content throughout the oil\n\n# Petroleum Technology Development Fund Act No 25 of 1973\n\nThe Petroleum technology Development Fund (PTDF) was established by Act No. 25 of 1973, which replaced the Gulf Oil Company Training Fund (Administration) Act, 1964 and vested in the Fund all the assets and responsibilities of the defunct Gulf Oil Company Training Fund.\n\n# Purposes of the Fund\n\nto provide scholarships and bursaries, wholly or partially in universities, colleges, institutions and in petroleum undertakings in Nigeria or abroad;\n\nto maintain, supplement, or subsidise such training or education as specified in paragraph (a) of this section;\n\nto make suitable endowments to faculties in Nigerian universities, colleges, or institutions approved by the Minister;\n\nto make available suitable books and training equipment in the institutions specified in paragraph (c) of this section;\n\nfor sponsoring regular or as necessary visits to oilfields, refineries, petro-chemical plants, and for arranging any necessary attachments of personnel to establishments connected with the development of the petroleum industry; and\n\nfor financing of and participation in seminars and conferences which are connected with the petroleum industry in Nigeria or abroad.\n\n# Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun Act No. 37 of 1972\n\nPetroleum Training Institute was set up by Act No. 37 of 1972, which was amended by Act No. 52 of 1975:\n\nto provide courses of instruction, training research in oil technology and to produce technicians and such skilled personnel normally required for oil production.\n\nTo arrange conferences, seminars, and study groups related to the field of learning. To this end, the Institute offers regular academic programmes leading to the award of National Diploma and Higher Diploma in the following Departments: 1. Electrical Engineering 2. Instrumentation and Control 3. Electronics and Telecommunications\n\n4. Power and Machine 5. Petroleum Engineering 6. Mineral Resources Engineering\n5. Petroleum and Natural Gas Processing Technology8. Mechanical Engineering\n6. Manufacturing Technology 10. Power Plant Technology 11. Welding Engineering\n7. Commercial Diving 13. Industrial Safety and Environmental Technology\n8. Petroleum Marketing and Business Studies 15. Science Lab Technology\n\n# The Petroleum Act of 1969\n\n# Chapter IV – Conduct of Petroleum Activities (Article 23 -Work Practices)\n\n1. (i) conservation of Petroleum resources, which implies the utilization of adequate methods and processes to maximize the recovery of hydrocarbons in a technically and economically sustainable manner, with a corresponding control of reserves decline, and to minimize losses at the surface;\n\n(ii) operational safety, which entails the use of methods and processes that promote occupational security and the prevention of accidents;\n\n(iii) environmental protection, that calls for the adoption of methods and processes which minimize the impact of Petroleum Operations on the environment;\n\n# Tertiary Education Trust Fund Act, 2011\n\nThis Act repeals the Education Tax Act Cap. E4, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004 and Education Tax Fund Act No. 17, 2003 and establishes the Tertiary Education Trust Fund charged with the responsibility for imposing, managing and disbursing the tax to public tertiary institutions in Nigeria.\n\nThere is established the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (in this Act referred to as ―the Fund‖) for the rehabilitation, restoration and consolidation of tertiary education in Nigeria.\n\nThe Act charges the Tertiary Education Trust Fund charged with the responsibility for imposing, managing and disbursing The Education Tax to public tertiary education institutions in Nigeria; and for related matters.\n\n# Nigerian Maritime Administration And Safety Agency Act, 2007\n\nregulate and administer the certification of seafarers;\n\nestablished maritime training and safety standards;\n\nregulate the safety of shipping as regards the construction of ships and navigation ;.\n\nprovide search and rescue service;\n\nprovide directions and ensure compliance with vessel security measures;\n\ncarry out air and coastal surveillance;\n\nprovide direction on qualification, certification, employment and welfare of maritime labour;\n\ndevelop and implement policies and programmes which will facilitate the growth of local capacity in ownership, manning and construction of ships and other maritime infrastructure;\n\nChallenges Facing Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Industry\n\nDeficient infrastructural facilities for training\n\nAn improved educational infrastructure is needed.\n\nLack of adequate finance, insufficient pertinent technical expertise and unhelpful multi-national company’s attitude are impediments that should be removed.\n\nCorruption and mismanagement or opaque accountability.\n\nUnstable and even volatile political and economic environments in Nigeria.\n\nLack of appropriate training materials.\n\n# PTI as a Destination of Choice for Training and Certification in Oil and Gas Industry\n\nPTI since its existence has continued to take giant strides in meeting the objectives for which it was set up.\n\nThis is in the area of training the manpower needed to operate the essential sector of the Nigerian economy which is crude oil exploration, expliotation and processing.\n\nTo this end, the Institute offers regular academic programmes leading to the award of National Diploma and Higher Diploma in the following Departments: Petroleum Engineering and Geosciences, Petroleum and Gas Processing, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical/Electronic Engineering, Petroleum marketing and Business Studies, Industrial Safety and Environmental technology, and Welding and Underwater Operations Technology. The Institute also runs Pre-Diploma programmes in the above mentioned courses and Certificate programmes in General Welding Technology and Professional Diving Technology.\n\n100 percent of the institute’s programmes have been accredited by the National Board for Technical Education (NBTE).\n\nPTI as a Destination of Choice for Training and Certification in Oil and Gas Industry\n\nThe PTI Consultancy Limited: The PTI Consultancy Limited is a registered company wholly owned by PTI. This is a business outfit with a Chief Coordinator in charge. It enables us to quickly respond to openings purely on business grounds thereby eliminating the usual bottlenecks that have made doing business with most government agencies difficult.\n\nPTI Consultancy offers job oriented training through short and booster courses to meet the specific needs of the Oil and Gas and Allied Industry. There are other units within the Consult such as the Petroleum Analysis Laboratory (PAL), Conference Centre Complex,\n\nPrinting Press\n\nThere is also the Computer Technology Centre. The Institute is the nexus of the Nigerian Institute of Welding, Centre for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT).\n\n# CONCLUSION\n\nThe Oil and Gas Industry operate in a regulatory or legislative framework that sets standards for their continued operation.\n\nThis paper has revolved around the current situation concerning the legal and administrative framework as it concerns local training and certification in the oil and gas industry.\n\nThis paper underlines the concerns of the infective implementation of the relevant laws and policies and suggested that the destination of choice in competent training and certification in Oil and Gas Industry is the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI).\n\nThis paper recommends that the developed legal and regulatory framework should be fully addressed by the Nigerian government so as to promote proper and effective implementation of the Nigerian content policy which will aid in achieving industrial growth.\n\nThe Act establishing PTDF for example should be ammended to remove the word ―abroad‖ to encourage local development of manpower.\n\n# THANK YOU \n\nurl: https://pti.edu.ng/2023/05/31/post-utme-screening-exercise-into-the-national-diploma-programmes-of-pti-for-the-2023-2024-academic-session/ \n content: Back\n\n## Uncategorized\n\n![](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/academics-about-e1622094819588.jpg)\n\nThe Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) Effurun invites applications from suitably qualified candidates that sat for the Unified Tertiary Matriculation Examination (UTME) and scored 130 and above for the 2023/2024 Post UTME screening exercise into Full-time National Diploma (ND) programmes for the 2023/2024 Academic Session.

Until his appointment, Dr. H. A. Adimula was the Institute’s acting Principal and Chief Executive from July 4, 2020 to June 17, 2021. He was also the former Vice Principal of the Institute, from December 4, 2019 to July 4, 2020.\n\nDr. Adimula had his university education at the University of Ilorin where he graduated with a B.Sc. Chemistry (1985) and M.Sc. (Chemistry) 1989 and the University of Benin, where he earned his Ph.D. in 2010, with specialization in the ‘Modifications and Applications of Biopolymers’.\n\nIn 1990, he was appointed by the National Institute for Freshwater Fisheries Technology, New-Bussa, Niger state and was immediately deployed to head the Chemistry department of the Federal College of Freshwater Fisheries Technology, a subsidiary of the Institute.\n\nHe joined the services of the Petroleum Training Institute in 1992, as a Lecturer II and has by virtue of his hard work and outstanding contributions to the progress and actualization of the objectives of the Institute rose to the headship of the Petroleum Training Institute.\n\nDr. H. A. Adimula has had a distinguished career at the PTI and has held various offices of high responsibilities. He served as Head, Department of Industrial Safety and Environmental Technology (ISET) between 2014 and 2017. As the head of the largest single Department in the Institute, he built a team of motivated staff, promoting and nurturing harmonious working relationships. In the middle of his tenure as Head of the Department, he was saddled with the higher responsibility of piloting the affairs of the newly established Directorate of Research and Development (R&D) as the pioneer Director in December, 2017. As Director of Research and Development, he established a 5-year plan for transforming the research culture of the Institute and created research clusters to address the various technological challenges of the oil and gas industry with a goal to developing home grown technology and to deepen the Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry.\n\nHe also served as the Director of Science from July 2018 to December 2019. As the Director of Science, he worked with the other Directors and top Management to formulate policies and the strategic directions for the Institute until he was appointed by the Governing Council of the Institute in December 2019, to occupy the vacant position of Vice Principal. As the Vice Principal, he was saddled with the responsibility of repositioning the Institute to better respond to the emerging trends in the oil and gas industry and leading the Institute to become a skills-certifying centre for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. He served in this capacity until his appointment as the Ag. Principal in July 2020, and as the substantive Principal and Chief Executive on June 17, 2021. He has since then been embarking on projects and initiatives aimed at more closely aligning the Institute to solving the technological challenges and the training needs of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria in particular and the rest of the world.\n\nDr. Adimula is well respected for his research works seeking solutions to the problems of pollution of the environment by the Nigerian oil and gas industry. He is a two time winner of the PTDF Research Grant competition for his research to **_“Develop Immobilized Oil Degrading Microorganisms in Local Cellulosic Materials for Rapid Deployment in the Remediation of Oil Polluted Soils”_**.

B. 20, EFFURUN\n\nCOMMUNIQUEISSUEDATTHEENDOFTHEWORKSHOPOFLEARNINGMANAGERSOFOIL/GASANDALLIEDCOMPANIESANDPTIMANAGEMENT HELDONTHURSDAY19IMAY,2016ATTHEPTDFTOWERS,PETROLEUMTECHNOLOGYDEVELOPMENTFUND,(PTDF),ABUJA.\n\nThe following resolutions were reached at the Learning Mangers' Workshop of the Oil/Gas and Allied Companies and PTI Management which was hosted by the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) at the PTDF Towers, Abuja on ${19^{\\\\mathrm{th}}}$ May,2016.\n\nThe workshop noted the following:\n\n1. That the Learning Mangers Workshop provided a viable platform for sharing knowledge and ideas on the challenges confronting the Oil and Gas industry with a view to exploring viable solutions towards addressing these challenges.\n\n2.That Nigeria was ranked as having the $9^{\\\\mathrm{th}}$ largest Gas reserves in the world having over One Hundred and Eighty-Seven Trillion cubic feet (187,000,000,000,000 ft3) of Gas and urged the Oil and Gas Industry to create innovative ways in harnessing this enormous potential.\n\n3. That a good pipeline integrity management system would go a long way in managing the pipelines and preventing losses. The workshop concluded that vandalisation of pipeline coupled with massive corrosion are the major challenges confronting pipeline management in the country and recommended that to manage pipelines effectively, Nigeria must grow its domestic Gas market, bridge the supply gap issues in the supply chain by reducing gas flaring for higher gas recovery to meet power needs, stimulation of investment in hydrocarbon pipeline gathering system, ensure enhanced domestic pipelines security operations, safety and control of vandalism, criminal activity, aerial surveillance among others.\n\n4. That to effectively curtail losses due to pipeline vandalism, Nigeria must overcome the toxic and explosive relationship between the Government, corporate establishments and their host communities.\n\n5. The workshop identified the Petroleum Training Institute as a veritable agency for mediation between Government, corporate bodies and host communities to achieving lasting industrial harmony through public enlightenment, technical skills acquisition programmes, competency building for the youth and conflict resolution workshop.\n\n6. The workshop urged the Government to hasten the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to attract the requisite Foreign Direct Investment (FDl) into the Oil and Gas Industry.\n\n7. Government should activate the steel industry in order to establish the basic steel infrastructure for easy access to steel products and its auxiliary facilities for effective pipeline management.\n\n8. The workshop commended the efforts of the Government on its crusade against corruption and urged Government to utilize the facilities and man power of PTl for management, in its attempts at curtailing corruption and sharp practices.\n\n9. The workshop encouraged the Petroleum Training Institute to develop a comprehensive programme in Pipeline Engineering towards the effective management of pipelines in the country.\n\n10.
