Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas
personnel to meet the challenges of their companies
especially, in this competitive business environment. The
global oil market gas been massively impeded by the
COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the
global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much
pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a
result, most companies are developing cost eective
technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has
developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic
needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to
improve the eciency of key operations in the industry.
As you peruse through the training brochure, we have
designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of
the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the
workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually
(online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to
address the specific need of a company.
At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing
competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery
at optimal cost.
PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil
and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival
any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

PORE PRESSURE PREDICTION METHODS:
A predrill estimate of formation pore pressure is a key
requirement for successful exploration and drilling. During
the exploration phase, knowledge of the spatial distribution
of formation pressures can be used to develop fluid
migration models, to study the eectiveness of seals, and to
rank prospects. During the drilling phase, a pre-drill pore
pressure estimate allows the appropriate mud weight to be
selected and the casing program to be optimized, thus
enabling safe and economic drilling.
Course Content
 This course will cover the fundamental principles of pore
pressure modeling and application to oil field problems. The
basic concepts used in pore pressure prediction will be
presented, and methods for estimating pore pressure using
log and seismic data will be explained and discussed. The

discussion will focus on deriving a calibrated pore pressure
model from seismic velocities. This implies calibration with
oset well data in order to derive a calibrated velocity-to-
pore pressure transform.
Learning Outcomes
By understanding how the pre-drill pore pressure model is
built, and what kind of calibration data is necessary, the
course participant will get a sense of how to update and re-
calibrate the model in real time while drilling. The following
topics will be addressed: Processes responsible for
abnormal pressure, Methods of pore pressure prediction and
detection, Data requirements and how to deal with data
gaps, Model calibration, Advantages and disadvantages of
seismic and resistivity-based pore pressure prediction, Real
time updating and uncertainty analysis.

# PTI Leading in High-tech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector

The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) prides itself as the leading technological Institute for the development of high-end technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector.

Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas personnel to meet the challenges of their companies especially, in this competitive business environment. The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil $&$ gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry.

As you peruse through the training brochure, we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company.

At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.

PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

Dr. Henry A. Adimula, Principal & Chief Executive, Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun, Delta State

 content: # Oil Producers, PTI to partner for Manpower Development

The Oil Producers Trade Section, OPTS, has promised to join forces with the Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun, Delta State to develop the manpower needed in the changes in the oil industry in Africa.

This was revealed during a visit of OPTS officials led by Mr. Gweke Ajaifia, Executive Director, Oil Producers Trace Section to PTI management. In his welcome speech, the Acting Principal of the PTI, Engr. Dr. Samuel E. Onoji expressed the readiness of PTI for the partnership.

Onoji, represented by Dr. (Mrs.) Tina Olubukola Isichei, the Director of Research and Development, took the visitors through the various capacities and research the institution had achieved in the past 50 years.

According to Isichei, “PTI has led in research and consultancy in oil and gas technology to produce technicians and other skilled personnel in the industry not only in Nigeria but across Africa. “And indeed, the reason for the establishment of the institute was part of the requirements of the country to the fans of OPEC as the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.

“Now our mission is to become the leading oil and gas Technological Institute in Africa while our mission is to provide competent technological manpower, to quality training, research, and consultancy for the pendulum and allied industries. “Now, we have been in this business for over 50 years. We celebrated our Golden Jubilee in 2022. And I must say that we have produced more than 50,000 technologists, technicians, and other technical personnel in various areas in the oil and gas and allied industries.” She added. In his speech, Ajaifia said, $\\mathfrak{w}\_{\\mathbb{I}}$ am very impressed with the visit to the Petroleum Training Institute. OPTS is a partner with the people of Nigeria in terms of the oil and gas business and we are supportive of Nigerian content. We are supportive of developing competence in the oil and gas operations.

${\\mathrm{"}}{\\mathsf{S}}\_{0},$ our visit today has shown the high degree of capacity and potential that the Petroleum Institute has in helping to bridge the gap we see in competence and capacity within the oil and gas industry. “We are going to work with the school authority to try to find ways of helping the industry to develop that needed capacity, not only for Nigeria but also for the rest of Africa.

“We see a lot of potential in this institution, and we are going to do our best to support PTI as a major capacity hub in the oil and gas industry.

“Today is like a homecoming for me. And I believe that there is there’s more opportunity to develop leaders for the future in this country.

“Now PTI has contributed a lot to the quality of leadership we have in the oil and gas industry. A lot of the graduates of these institutes are in high places in the country, some have developed their own businesses that are highly successful.

“And I think that what we need to do is to support the institution in terms of funding, so that they can take the linear role in terms of research, because we need research, to be able to develop that level of independence.

“You know, if you don’t have independence, then you are not here. So PTI has the potential to lead in terms of research and development in our sector. And I think providing them with the required funding, and opportunity, the school will we go to higher places.” He stated.

 content: # Dr. Celestine Iyamu Emerges the National President of the PTI Alumni Association

Dr Celestine Iyamu recently emerged the National President of the Alumni Association of the Petroleum Training Institute, (PTI) Effurun, assuring that his team has a lot of visions and plans to take the alumni to greater heights.

In his word, “We will contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of the oil and gas sector of the nation’s economy as alumni of the PTI. It is on good record that graduands of this great Institute are proud of the school. Many of us have also gone to other institutions to get higher degrees and certificates. But the PTI is our base, so we are very proud of the school”.

Speaking further, Dr. Iyamu noted that, $\\mathfrak{w}\_{\\mathbb{I}}$ have three years tenure as the president, and I want to focus on three areas. One is to complete the PTI alumni building started by the old executive in the school. Within a space of one year, we should complete that building.

“Secondly, I also want to get our graduands all over the world that are yet to be active in the alumni to come in. Many of them are in high places. For instance, Professor Kalu Osiri, in the United States of America, he is the owner of a university, he graduated from the PTI. He has assured he would come on board.

“The third vision is to give the alumni a political power, that power that will help us take the alumni to greater heights. Outside finance, we need the political power as a body to attract government’s attention. It will make government give the Institute attention. We should develop the links with political leaders”.

Speaking on the poor funding facing the Institute, Dr. Iyamu said, “My appeal to Mr. President is that politics should not come into the PTI. The government should give adequate funding to the PTI, compel the Petroleum Technology Development Fund, (PTDF) to fund the PTI adequately, Tertiary Education Trust Fund, (TETfund) and other agencies should do the same”.

In the words of Dr. Iyamu, “Mr. President should see the PTI as one instrument to up-scale his achievements. The Ministry of Petroleum resources should ensure that the Institute gets adequate funding for the Institute. Also, The Federal Government can engage the alumni in finding solutions to challenges in the oil and gas sector. We can be part of government panels and committees to provide solutions. We have many of our graduands that are playing great roles in the oil and gas sector across the globe.

“The current National president of Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria, (PENGASSAN), Engr Festus Osifo is a product of the PTI. So, you see we have many of the right persons that can help government add value to the oil and gas sector”, he noted.

SenDr）feanyiOkowaTheExecutiveGovenorofDeltaState(L）respondingtotheaddressof th Principal/ChiefExecutive of PTl,ProfSurny E.lyuke

Governor, Sen. (Dr) Ifeanyi Okowa has assured the Management of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI),Effurun that his administration would partner the Institute on the proposed construction ofmodular refineries which aims to engage the youths and curb oil bunkering in the region.

modular refineries would go a long way in reducing the incidences ofoil

bunkering. pipeline

vandalism aswell as

reduce the rate of crime in the region.Governor

Okowa promised to liaise with the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr.Emmanuel Ibe

Kachikwu to see how this laudable initiative by the Institute could be

actualized.

The Governor,who gave the assurance recently at the government house,Asaba when the Principal/Chief Executive of PTl, Prof. Sunny E. lyuke led the Management team of theInstitute to the government house on a courtesy visit,said his government would equally collaborate with the Institute on skills development projects.

He said setting up

Senator Okowa also promised to open the Institute's drainage system that has been blocked as well as the right of way which has been encroached upon.He equally pledged to commence works on the deplorable roads around the Institute.

Accordingto the Governor,"There are rays ofhope from all you said;

will handle it as soon as possible".

Commending the (DiPTI) project which he described as a great innovation,the Governor said, “I want to congratulate you on the DiPTI project, it is a commissioner for youth will liaise with you; we are looking forward to it. The areas of training are important to Delta state as This visit is a welcome development,we hope to find away to maintain and build on this relationship weneed to have the details of your Institute's training programme so that the Chief Job Creation Officer in the state could liaise with your Institute for some beneficiaries of the different skills acquisition programmes in order to utilize the Institute's facilities. On the issue of right of way,we will take it up,the Commissioner for environment and works

Speaking on security challenges in and around the Effurun community,the Governor pointed out that security issue was not limited to the Institute,noting that security challenge is a national issue.He however said that kidnapping has reduced in the state as a result of the continued onslaught on kidnapers' dens by security operatives.

He decried the situation where most of the arrested kidnapers wereyoung men who were not from the southern part of the country, and called for vigilance among the people in the state.

The Governor,Sen.(Dr） Ifeanyi Okowa,receiving a souvenir from the Principal/CEof PTI.Prof.S.E.lyuke(R)

According to the Governor,“Following the Delta State Anti-Cultism and Anti-Terrorism Bill 2016 signed into law recently,the judiciary has been very proactive,six special courtshave been set up to allow speedy trial of those arrested for acts of terrorism and kidnapping".

On the issue of Delta State Glass Company, the Governor disclosed that the State was in the process of privatizing the company, and hoped that the process would produce a success story.He however regretted that the revitalization of Asaba Textile Mill may not be at sight soon given the too many challenges as it concerned receivership of the company; but promised that his administration was working on it in the overall interest of all Deltans.

Earlier, the Principal/Chief Executive, PTI,Prof. Sunny lyuke called on the Governor to partner with the PTI which was set up to train Technicians and Technologists and skilled personnel normally required for the oil and gas industry.

Prof. lyuke posited that the Institute provides hands on training for youths,which he hoped to achieve through Digitalization of the PTI (DiPTI) project.He said the DiPTI project when completed would provide jobs for theyouthsreduce criminality,remove the youths from the streets and militants from the Creeks.

He said the PTI could key into the SMART Agenda of the Governor, especially in strategic wealth creation and provision of jobs through skills acquisition training adding that"The youths can be trained in welding and fabrication, drilling pipe and joinery, diving. electrical installation”, among others.

Still on job creation, Prof Iyuke called for the building of modular refineries in different parts of the region in order to engage the youths who are deep into illegal refining.

Inhis words,"We have trained for

OSOPADEC,Rivers State Government, SPDC, and Amnesty Programme for militants.At the end,

some of them were

employed by the oil

companies.The physically challenged can also be

trained.The structures are there but require basic

equipment to take off.The $\\mathrm{FTI}\_{\\uparrow}$ in collaboration with the Delta State

Government can partner in these regards.Thus

realizing Mr.Governor's

SMART Agenda through

skills acquisition.

Continuing.“As I mentioned earlier on buildingmodular refineries,if we had one or two licenses,locate the refineries in strategic places,these boys doing illegal refining now can be legally engaged.What they have now is crude system ofrefining and I can assure you that they know the job,it is the system that has not given them the empowerment and

perhaps the facilities,but when we now give them licenses,we will bring them to PTl and train them,we have good Petroleum and Refining Department,we will train them on how to refine the petroleum properly.Of course,the modular refinery should be able to employ atleast 100youths if am not exaggerating and by the time we have two or three of that in Delta state believe me, we will be able to remove some of these boys from the streets and creeks".

lyuke who expressed the hope that the visit would foster closer ties with the Delta State Government so that PTI could feel the presence of the state in the Institute; stressing that over $50%$ of the Institute's students population were Deltans;hence,the need to collaborate with the state government.

He also called on the governor to intervene in reactivating the drainage system in the Institute which has been blocked and the right of way to the river has been encroached on as a result ofillegal buildings.

The Institute's boss, who appealed to the Governor to revamp the Delta Glass and Asaba Textile mill companies, assured that the PTI could partner with the state government to provide ways of reactivating them as the companies were veritable sources of employment for the youths.This,he said, could reduce youth restiveness if they were gainfully employed.He promised the Governor that PTI wasprepared to work with his administration to restore the glory of the State and bring prosperity to all Deltans.

he hope of providing appropriate skills for the teaming youths in Delta State may soon come alive with the plans mapped out by the Warri Refining and Petrochemical Company (WRPC) and Petroleum Training Institute on youth skills acquisition programme at thePTl Skill Acquisition Centre,Osubi Campus.

This was disclosed by the duo of theWRPC Managing Director, Mr. A.S. Ladenegan and the Principal/Chief Executive of Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Prof. Sunny lyuke when the latter paid a courtesy visit to the WRPC Management Board recently.

Mr.Ladenegan,while playing host to the PTI Management team noted that it is only when the youths are appropriately equipped and engaged, will the nation and the region in particular experience relative peace,adding that WRPC cannot thrive if the youths in the host communities were on the street. According to him,"it is only fair that we make our impact felt in our host communities, which is why WRPCmustcollaborate with PTl to pull our youths off the street".

The WRPC boss, who commended the new PTI Chief Executive for the innovations he has introduced in the Institute within his short arrival, assured him that WRPC would partner with the

Institute to actualize its mandate and vision.

In his words,“I must commend the Principal/Chief Executive of PTI,Prof. Sunny lyuke for the great plans he has for the Institute. I want to assure you of our collaboration both in staff exchange, skills acquisition, laboratory services and host of other services the Institute can render to WRPC".

Earlier, Prof. S.E. lyuke called for synergy between the PTI and WRPC in the areas of Skill acquisition for the teaming youths in the country especially in the host communities,power supply; staff exchange programme and laboratory services among others.

He disclosed that the Institute's skills acquisition centre, Osubi campus would soon be

commissioned,this,he said would create a lotof

activities for youths in the country.

Going down memory lane, Prof. lyuke recalled that the Institute was and still the only body approved by the Federal Government to train technical manpower for the oil/gas industry in the country but regretted the proliferation of many training bodies especially by the International Oil Companies (IOCs).

His words,"our mandate by the Federal Government is to train technical manpower; 1 learnt recently during our last learning Managers' workshop that some lOCs are doing their own skill development which to me is almost illegal. PTI is mandated by law to do those training and apart

from the training: we also award certificates which these companies do not give".

He called for collaboration in staff exchange, live projects and supervision for final year students as well as Industrial Training Attachment (IT) for the students, adding that PTI graduates get hands on teaching and upon graduation do not necessarily need on the job training

While stating that the PTI has always maintained a sought-after track record in the development of competent technical manpower for the nation's oil and gas sector, Prof. lyuke reaffirmed his resolve to ensure the repositioning of the PTl and its placement on the global arena.

# PTI Is The Only Legal Institute For Technological Manpower Development For Oil & Gas Sector-Don

Seeks More Govt.Funding,IOCs Patronage

BrownA.Ukanefimoni

he Petroleum TrainingInstitute (PTI),located in the oil jugular of Delta State is the only Institute legally mandated for the development of competent technological manpower for the nation's oil and gas sector.This assertion was made by Dr.Akpofure Rim-Rukeh,an Associate Professor, of the Federal University of Petroleum Resources,Effurun,at the 2nd bi-annual Learning Managers'Workshopof Oil/Gas and Allied Companies and PTI Management sponsored by National Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) at Stallion House, Ikoyi,Lagos recently.

Delivering a paper entitled, "Legislative Policies and Regulatory FrameworkIn EnhancingLocal Training and Certification In Oil and Gas Industry”,Dr.Akpofure called ongovernment and law makers to rejig therelevant laws for the PTI to perform its mandatory functions as enshrined in the Act establishing the Institute.He bemoaned the current situation where so many illegal institutions and companies were now involved in training of manpower for the oil and gas sector.

Stressing the impact of training and certification for the oil and gas workers,he stated that the development ofemployeeswas imperative in thelightof evolvingjob description, dynamic technology and environmental regulation in the industry. To achieve structured training and sustainable growth in the oil sector,there was need for soundnational lawsandpolicies that could easily be implemented, said Akpofure.

Going through the memory lane of the extant Acts andregulatory Agencies such as thePetroleum Act, 1969,PTDFActof1973,NDDCAct, 2000,Nigerian Content Development Act,2005,Nigerian Oil and Gas

Industry Content Development Act, $2010,$ and the PTI Act CAP P16, 2004,as amended,established in 1973,as a pre-requisite for the membership of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC),the University Don called on all stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to implement the oil policies in the country.

Dr.Akpofure who described PTI as a destination of choice for training and certification in the oil and gas Industry,observed that the Institute has taken great strides in meeting the objective for which it was set up,the development of manpower needed to operate the essential sector of the nation's economy,which was crude oil exploration,exploitation and processing.

He expressed the view that oil companies should operate within the regulatory framework;they should ensure that their workers are structurally trained and able to demonstrate that they could apply knowledge and skills to the standard legally required.

The Don also underlined the concerns of the ineffective implementation of the relevant laws, policies and the destination of choice in competent training and certification in the oil and gas industry is the Petroleum Training Institute.

He recommended that"the developed legalandregulatory framework should befully addressed by the Nigerian government so as to promote properandeffective implementation of the Nigerian Content Policy which will aid in achievingindustrial growth":

Earlier,the Principal/Chief Executive of the Institute,Prof. Sunny E.Iyuke,made passionate appeal for a better funding and support from the government and patronage of theInternational Oil Companies(IOCs)to enable PTI fulfill its statutory functions of developing theneeded workforce for the oil industry.To develop a corresponding trainingin line with global standards,the Principal called for assistance in the development of research,cutting edge training facilities and Digitization of Petroleum Training Institute (DiPTI).

Prof. lyuke also solicited for collaboration in staff exchange and Industrial Training Attachment (IT) for the students,adding that PTI graduates get hands on teaching and upon graduation do not necessarily need on the job training. He expressed thebelief that PTI graduates possess good quality skills toperform whatever taskwith little orwithout supervision.The IOCs who had PTl products in their employ could attest to thisfact.

On the need for collaboration between PTI and the IOCs,"PTI has grown.The companieshad also developed.With their support,I am sure we will be there.We come to

you for training andyou support us. Ifyou do not support us,we would not find it easy”,he averred.

lyuke further stressed that the IOCs should have confidence in the PTl,as it has an enviable track record in the development of competent technical manpower for the nation's oil and gas sector.He reiterated, $^{41}$ will transform the PTI to a world-class Institute thatwill train and provide competent manpower required for the operation of the oil and gas and allied companies in and around the globe.

He gave the inkling that the Institute wouldreview its programmes and ensure that its certificates remained apropos to the sector.He went further to say that PTI has signed a deal with the Ministry of Energy of Benin Republic for the trainingofitspersonnel in Petroleum and GasProcessing. Geosciences and Petroleum Marketing and Business Studies.

Also,to place the Institute on the global map,the PTI would be digitized.According to the new Principal/Chief Executive,the digitization of the PTl,sobriquet DiPTl,would be designed to assist the youth to achieve their aspiration. The DiPTl would be a place of new beginning;the projectwould be really about youths,creating jobs for the future and a space for digital innovation,he said cheerily.

Prof. lyuke called on all stakeholders in the Oil Industry to support the PTI to move it to the next level;and to be a choice destination for the development of competentmanpower for the nation's oil and gas sector and beyond.

Also speaking,the General Manager,Services,NAPIMS who was represented by Mr.Loveday Mina, lauded therolePTI played in the past in the development ofmiddle level manpower,adding that quite a number of them were trained in the Institute.

He promised thatNAPIMSwould collaborate with PTl to achieve its goals,and enjoined other stakeholders tojoin handswith PTI to develop the needed manpower for the oil and gas sector.

# Stakeholders ListWays on How to Curb Pipeline Vandalism, Militancy in Niger Delta

In the same vein,stakeholders who earlier convened at the lst bi annual learningManagers of Oil/gas and Allied Companiesand PTI Management hosted by Petroleum TechnologyDevelopment Fund (PTDF) in Abuja recently,had listed ways on how to curb the incessant pipeline vandalism,oil theft, kidnapping and militancy in the country,especially in the oil rich Niger Delta region.

To effectively curb these vices, theworkshopmaintained that Nigeria must overcome the toxic and explosive relationshipbetween the corporate organizations and their host communities.

The workshop pinpointed the PTI as a veritable agency for mediation between government, corporate bodies and host communities to achieve lasting industrialand peaceful host community relations thereby curbing incessant attacks on pipelines.

In view of the massive corruption which has retarded the growth of the oil industry,they urged the government to expedite thepassage of thePetroleum Industry Bill (PIB)to attract the requisite foreign direct investment (fdi) into the oil and gas sector.

The stakeholders also stressed the need to develop the steel industry in order to establish the basic steel infrastructure for easy access to steelproducts and its auxiliary facilities for effective pipeline management.

The workshop called on the government to utilize the facilities of thePTl as themajor training Institute in the country backed by an actofparliament for the development ofcompetent technical manpower for the oil andgas sector.

On the need to galvanize the PTl, the learning Managers asked the Federal Government to enact relevant legislations to engage PTl in conjunction with Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR)in ensuring thatpetroleum products imported into the countrymeet

acceptable standards in terms of quality and safety.

The stakeholders applauded the unique role of the PTl as the only trainingInstitute that provides the trainingsolution to the contemporary training requirement, in the oil and gas sector.

In a keynote address,the Vice Principal,PTl,Mrs.Emily E. Arhagba,posited that the workshop was very significant to the sustainability of development in the oil and gas sector,with emphasis on the training of the next generation of leaders who constitute themiddle level managers in the industry.

"Any genuine discussion on energy must revolve around a seamless transfer ofnew and emergent skills to this critical group on whom the future of the industry rests",stated Mrs.Arhagba.

The Vice Principal further said thatPTI has an enviable trackrecord in the development of competent technical human capital for the nation's oil industry to tool and retool oil personnel to effectively handle these challenges.

Earlier, the then Acting Executive Secretary,Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) Mr.Ahmed G.Aminu disclosed thatwith the estimated proven gasreservesof182 trillion cubic feet,the sector if effectively harnessed is capable of enhancing the economic growth potentialof the nation particularly if the gas that is being flared is channel to complement domestic energy demand.

"Wemust workhard to developnew strategiesto complementgovernmenteffort to achieving a viable,sustainable and efficient oil and gas sector”,he submitted.

Speaking on the theme, "The fear of God”,Bishop Avwomakpa maintained thatit would take the collective resolve of all staff members to achieve the PTI set goals as the

Principal/Chief Executive cannot do it alone.

Readingfrom the book ofProverbs chapter $\\mathbb{Q}\_{:10}^{\\scriptscriptstyle\*}$ he said,where the fear of God is,there is also the fear of man, adding that the fear of God is the foundation of wisdom.

He called on the Principal/Chief Executive tohave the fear of God rather than the fear of man sighting Joseph in the Portiphar's house as a reason why men ought to fear God rather than men.

According to him, "Once you decided to fear God,satan would make you many offers including strange women, but you should be able to sayno to the leading of the devil, avoid sin for it delays progress and takes away your boldness.I pray for the growth and wellbeingof the Institute and for God's divine wisdom and protection on the Principal and his Management team".

Onyinyechi Udemezue/VictorAbigor

hePrincipal/Chief Executive of thePetroleum Training Institute (PTI),Prof. Sunny lyuke has reiterated that the proposed Digital Petroleum Training Institute (DiPTI) project when completed would put the PTl on the global map as thebasis ofa new set ofachievers and create skill personnel whowould evolve to being employers of labour.

Disclosing this recently at a meeting with representatives of Cyberspace Nigeria Limited,a leadingInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) Company who would anchor the DiPTI project, Prof. lyuke said the DiPTI project also seeks to engage the Nigerian teaming youth as well as build a society where the young can contribute to development without looking at crude oil.

Speaking further,the Institute's Chief Executive noted that“from the beginning when I conceived the idea, I knew it is somethingwe could do, because in the South African University where I came from,we have a similar project,though different format,but it is the same idea of digitization.So when I came to PTl,I saw the potential,we have staff that are ready and hard working.and with these quality of staff in place,we can actually run”.

Prof.lyuke,however quipped that in the interim,inconsistent electricity power supply and funding would be themain constrain to the taking off of the project. He expressed optimism that once regularpower supply is guaranteed, the project couldbe actualized with ease.

While commending Cyberspace Management for their professionalism,the Institute's boss added that,“having Cyberspace as partner make the job a lot easy,they seem to understand the project better.With this project in place,I can assure you that the future of PTl is bright,we will do all we can to project the PTl to a world class institution".

He applauded Cyberspace for their performance so far,including making the ICT centre an accredited centre for Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board,JAMB CBT. lyuke hinted that Information Technology is the bedrockof economy growth ofany nation and that PTl must occupy the driver's seat.

To achieve this goal, he explained his determination to source for funds from the private sector both locally and internationally.Also,plans would be geared towards making the ICT centre a hub for certification of professional bodies such as CiSCO. "Plans are on to create staff exchange programme betweenPTIand Cyberspace thatwould explore and create avenue for fresh technical ideas among staff members”,he posited.

The Executive Officers of Cyberspace led by the Group Head, Software Business,Mr.Paul Olawale said Cyberspace as an ICT company wouldprovide wired &wireless as well as internet services thatwould power theproject.

The company,he said would also provide grade security solution,E learning:open distance learning and innovative hub,data centre infrastructure;servers and storages as well as robust collaboration solution.

Describing the DiPTl asmindblowing and a great innovation, Mr. Olawalereaffirmed that theproject will definitelyposition the Institute on the global map.

# How Greenhouse Effect Occurs in Hot Car

Dr.OLOWOYO,D.N.(FHRD,PICCON) Deputy Director,Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun,Delfa State,Nigeria.

# What is Greenhouse Effect?

he process ofgreen house effect reminds us of theheat trapping effect of glass walls in a horticultural greenhouse. In a similar way,the earth's atmosphere bottles up the energyofthe sun and said to act like a“greenhouse” where CO2 acts like glass windows since Co2 molecules are transparent to sunlightradiation butnot tothe heat radiation. However,Green house effect can be defined as the progressive warming up of the earth's surface due to blanketing effect of manmadeC02inthe atmosphere or as the phenomenon due to which earth retains heat. The major green house gases are:

Carbon-dioxide(most common and important greenhouse gas) Methane (CH4). Nitrous oxide(CFCs). +Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Watervapour (proportion varies with temperature). Aerosol spray (in form of perform,deodorant, fragrance,etc, commonly used in car).

The greenhouse effect is not a bad thing by itself because it allowed earth to stay warmenough forlife to survive.Under normal concentration of CO2,the temperature of the earth's surface ismaintained by the energy balance of the sun rays that strike the planet and the heat thatisradiated into the outer space. Consequently,when the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere increases beyond normal,the thick envelope of this gas absorbs radiation from sun and prevents the heat from beingre-radiated out.

Thus,the thick CO2 layer acts like the glass panels ofa green house or thewindowglass ofa closed car,allowingthe sun rays to filter through but preventing the heat from escaping in the outer space there warming the troposphereof the atmosphere that eventually resulting to atmospheric and climatic changes.

How Greenhouse Effect isproduced in a Car

When we park our car outside for some hours where there is no shade of any kind and the car is in direct glare of the sun with windows closed since we are afraid of car theft. At the point of leaving,when we open the door of the car and entre inside,our body experiences ahigher temperature difference. This is because of the difference between ambient outdoor temperature and the temperature inside the car.

The knowledge of thermodynamics guides us of the thermal equilibrium that supposed to exist insidethe car andits surrounding.but the total heat energy in the car is not simply due to the energy entering the car from the sun or from thermal contact with the atmosphere.It is much higher due to the heat trappingactionof the greenhouse effect.

The sun'sradiations enter through your car's windows and some of the heat from the sun is absorbed by the seats/belt seats, dashboards, carpets, rugs,upholstery etc.when these objects release this heat, it does not all get out through the windows but ratherreflected backin.The heat isradiated at different wavelength less than the wavelength of sun's radiation that made it through the windows.Thus, as more heat energy is going in,less is going out. This resultsinto agradual increase in the heat that is produced in the car until it gets tounbearable point that when you open your car,you feel the heat trapping greenhouse effect in the car,which is similar to thegreenhouse effectyou experienceinthe troposphere.

The excessive exposure to solar radiations through greenhouse effect in a hot car can cause thefollowing:

Skincancer Alterimmune system Vulnerable infectious diseases 中Cataract and eyediseases $\\hat{\\mathbf{\\xi}}\_{\\mathbf{p}}^{\\mathbf{\\xi}}\\mathbf{\\bar{\\eta}}$ Heatstroke

The following preventive methods can be explored to reduce greenhouse effect in ahotcar:

$\\clubsuit$ Do not wind up your car windows fully when you parked your car.

$\\clubsuit$ Always look for a shady area to parkyour car.

Use car cover or window shade when you are parking your car for a longtime.

Always wind down your car windows for at least between $^{2}-5$ minutes before you put your air conditioner into use.

Avoid the use of highly concentrated aerosol spray in formof perfume,deodorant, fragrance,insecticide etc especially when your car air conditioner isinuse.

# Conclusion

The greenhouse effect in a hot car is already traced to some health effects on human beings when exposed.However, some preventive methods suggested here would greatly help in curtaining or reducing the problems associated with these effects.Please,let us all take to these suggested points which can keep us away from thevulnerable diseases that can be caused by greenhouse effect in our vehicles.

KEYNOTE ADDRESS BY THE PRINCIPAL/CHIEF EXECUTIVE, PETROLEUM TRAINING INSTITUTE (PTI), PROF. SUNNY E. IYUKE ON THURSDAY, ${\\bf{29^{H}}}$ SEPTEMBER, 2016 ON THE OCCASION OF LEARNING MANAGERS’ WORKSHOP OF OIL/GAS AND ALLIED COMPANIES AND PTI MANAGEMENT HELD AT ELION HOUSE, DOLPHIN ESTATE, IKOYI, LAGOS.

THE DIRECTOR, DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES (DPR), THE MANAGING DIRECTOR, NAPIMS, MANAGEMENT OF PTI,

LEARNING MANAGERS OF OIL/GAS AND ALLIED COMPANIES, THE GUEST LECTURER, Dr. Akpofure Rime Rukeh DISTINGUISHED PARTICIPANTS, GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

It is with great delight and honour that I welcome you all to the $2016;2^{\\mathsf{n d}}$ bi-annual workshop of Learning Managers of Oil/Gas and Allied Companies and PTI Management which today is being graciously hosted by NAPIMS.

This workshop is very dear to me, being the first time to interface with learning Managers of the oil and gas industry following my appointment as the substantive Principal/Chief Executive of the PTI. From the records, I also observed that the workshop is held as scheduled this year. This is an indication that the oil companies are determined to support the Petroleum Training Institute to achieve its goals as the training and manpower development arm of the industry. May I thank all participants who have travelled far and wide to participate in today’s workshop. I have no doubt in my mind that your presence is a sign of your commitment, not only to PTI but to the petroleum industry and your desire to take it to the next level of growth and relevance.

It is a common knowledge that the PTI is statutorily saddled with the responsibility of developing competent technical manpower for the oil and gas sector and to carrying out research into oil and gas related activities, processes and products from upstream, midstream and downstream. Today’s workshop is part of your collaborative effort at enhancing her effectiveness through intellectual exchange and bridging the needs gap. It is against this background that learning Managers and Stakeholders have convened to brainstorm and develop a synergy between PTI and the industries. This workshop also provides a platform to collectively strategise to identify the challenges facing the oil and gas sector such as dearth of technical manpower, obsolete legislation, amongst others.

In view of the multifarious challenges currently confronting the oil and gas sector, we cannot stand aloof from what is happening in the country. We must key into the change mantra of this present administration. Therefore, it is the statutory responsibility of all stakeholders to join forces with the Institute to train technologists and technicians of sub professional level who can apply theoretical and practical knowledge to produce the desired results. I wish to state at this juncture, that PTI has an enviable track record in the development of competent technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector. I wish to reiterate that under the new PTI Management, the Petroleum Training Institute will be transformed to a world class Institute that will train and provide competent manpower required for the operations of the oil/gas and allied companies in and around the globe.

My Management team and I are determined to transform the PTI to be responsive to the needs of the industry. To this end, we have developed a road map to galvanize the PTI into activities of realizing its training and research mandate. The Institute will review its programmes and ensure the PTI certificate; HND and ND remain relevant to the needs of the oil and gas sector locally and internationally. Programmes of the Institute will be upgraded with provision of eclassrooms in collaboration with international Universities.

In the area of Research and Development (R&D), we will carry out research in Nigerian Refineries, Exploration and Production, metering, midstream and the entire value of the downstream oil and gas operations. Besides obtaining license for modular and Micro-refinery, the Institute will also carry out research and investment in Renewable Energy such as Bio- ethanol, Solar, Wind, etc. To realizing these laudable goals require huge funds. This is where Private Public Partnership (PPP) and active support from the international oil companies and oil industry stakeholders will be needed.

On ICT, we are in a technology-driven world. So for effectiveness and efficiency, and for the fact that PTI is a technological Institute, we must use cutting edge technology for training, learning, and research to enhance all operations. I am delighted to inform the workshop that strategic development will be launched to digitalize the Petroleum Training Institute, tagged ‘DIPTI’. DIPTI will be a place of new beginning; the project is really about youth, creating jobs of the future, and creating a space for digital innovation.

The project will provide forum where all courses are digitized for e-platform applications and delivery; Certification of Technologists and Technicians; Students Experimental Training; Intellectual and Technology transfer; and Staff Training for Certificate in Telecommunications Policy, Regulation and Management (TPRM). It is our hope that the upgraded PTI will look for organizations that will not only partner with the DiPTI but to grow the Institute into the future, but will also derive benefits from being involved in the PTI in general. Please, let us join hand to develop this project.

Distinguished ladies and gentlemen, may I inform you that the Institute has collaboration with the Ministry of Energy, Benin Republic to train her personnel in petroleum and gas processing, Petroleum and Geosciences and in Petroleum and Business Studies.

It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.

Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.

There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything.

All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures.

The project, which has enormous academic benefits, would be used for practical teaching and industrial attachment training for students. It would serve as centre for research and development purposes and will have some other commercial streams which could generate new revenue for the Institute.

…As Prof. Iyuke Unveils 5 Year Plan Lucky Akaighe & Precious Oroghwarejighe (IT) Student The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) would run a hybrid National Diploma leading to the award of Masters of Technology (M.Tech) within the next five years.

The Principal and Chief Executive of the Institute, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke dropped this hint while unveiling a five year plan for the Institute during a seminar entitled $^{\\prime\\prime}5$ -Year Plan of Academic Directorates”, aimed at repositioning the Institute in order to meet the 21st century challenges in the oil and gas sector.

Prof. Iyuke stated that the Petroleum Training Institute, would within the next five years award a Masters of Technology (M.Tech) to PTI graduates as against the Higher National Diploma (HND) certificate it had been awarding over four decades.

Justifying the award of the M.Tech, he said that following a meticulous study of the mandate establishing the Institute, there is no clause in the Act limiting it to the training of only middle level manpower; but skilled manpower required for the oil and gas Industry.

The Principal informed that he has presented this proposal to the Governing Council at its 134th meeting, and Council has given the nod to pursue the hybrid programme as long as it will move the Institute to the next level in the industry.

The Principal who was optimistic said when the plan comes on stream, PTI would run a hybrid ND to M.Tech programme in affiliation

Principal & Chief Executive, Prof. S.E. Iyuke

with the University of Port-Harcourt (Uniport) for three (3) years, and then go full blown having learnt the ropes within the specified years.

According to the Principal, the hybrid ND - M.Tech programme is intended to change the Institute's training capacity to meet the challenges and to be a standard Centre for carrying out research in energy resources.

A breakdown of the 5 year implementation plan leading to the award of M.Tech shows that the Institute would run a two year intensive academic training leading to the award of National Diploma (ND), one (1) year industrial training and then two (2) years continuation into Masters of Technology Programme.

He charged Staff members to always imbibe the spirit of confidentiality and to always make good use of the Institute's time in driving this vision.

# PTI Graduates 1,086 Technologists, Technicians for Oil and Gas Industry

\\* As Kachikwu assures of Federal Government continuous support to PTI \* To upgrade Diving School to international standard

Udemezue Onyinyechi I n its practical effort to shore up manpower in line with the Nigerian Local Content Policy in the oil and gas sector, the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, the foremost oil and gas Institute in Africa recently churned out 1,086 Technologists and Technicians into the sector.

Speaking recently at the 2018 PTI Graduation ceremony,

then Minister of State,

Petroleum Resources, Dr.

Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu

commended the Management of the Institute for its

continuous effort towards

developing competent

technological manpower

required for the operations of the petroleum and allied

companies as stipulated in the Act establishing the Institute.

Dr. Kachikwu reiterated that the Petroleum Training Institute is very dear to the Federal Government, given its strategic position in the sector. He revealed that machinery has been set in motion towards repositioning the Institute to serve the nation better, particularly the oil, gas and allied companies.

According to him, “The Federal Government has set up a Steering Technical Committee

on the repositioning of the

Institute. It is our desire that

after the review, the Institute will be expanded to take on

additional responsibilities

towards meeting the targets of President Muhammadu Buhari's administration for local content development in the Oil and Gas Industry”.

While noting the strategic importance of offshore technology to the nation's oil and gas industry, Dr. Kachikwu disclosed that Mr. President has directed that the PTI School of Diving should be upgraded to international standards assuring that efforts are ongoing to actualize the President's directives.

Then Minister who was represented by Mr. Idang Alibi assured the Institute's Management that the Federal Government would continue to support PTI to actualize its mandate.

“Let me also state that the Petroleum Training Institute, as

A Cross section of graduating students

a federal government

institution, was established to train technical manpower

needed in the oil, gas and allied companies. The Federal

Government will continue to

encourage, support and fund the Petroleum Training Institute to enable it fulfil its original

mandate of providing

competent technological

manpower through quality

training and re-training of

personnel in the oil and gas

sector, thereby reducing capital flight in conformity with the

change agenda of the present administration”, Dr. Kachikwu enthused.

Speaking further, Dr. Kachikwu said, “Today's gathering has presented yet another opportunity for us to reflect on the events shaping the Petroleum Industry and the expected roles to be played by the Petroleum Training Institute in keeping with its mandate. As you are aware, we are encountering problems that

have to do with high production cost, long contract life cycle, oil spills, crude oil theft and

insecurity among others. It is

our hope that the Institute can proffer solutions to these

problems through its training and skills acquisition

programmes”.

He added that the Federal Government has come out with a one-stop-shop arrangement for reviewing and approving projects in a bid to shorten contracting life cycle before the end of 2018. This, he said, would ensure that contract approval cycle is not more than six months; while the cost of crude oil production would be reduced.

Kachikwu retorted that the Federal Government plans to deliver not less than 3.4 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day to bridge the medium term supply gap by 2020, adding that government has decided to invest in the Seven Critical Gas Development Projects to achieve this feat in 2020 as the Federal Government had commenced utilization and monetization of the abundant gas resources of the country.

In his words, “The Federal Government has doubled her efforts in providing effective policies that will drive gas utilization and commercialization. We have decided to invest in the Seven Critical Gas Development Projects in Nigeria. These projects will deliver about 3.4 billion standard cubic feet of gas per day to bridge the mediumterm supply gap by $2020^{\\prime\\prime}$ .

While commending the PTI Management for its proactive measures in piloting the affairs of the Institute, Kachikwu tasked the PTI graduands to set goals that would give them a balanced and successful life. “I will also leave you with the words of Steve Jobs which says, “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown your own inner voice”, he advised.

Speaking, then PTI Governing Council Chairman, Mr. Mordecai D.B. Ladan appealed to International Oil Companies (IOCs) and stakeholders in the sector to always look inward and collaborate with the PTI in the areas of research and personnel training.

Then Council Chairman assured the Institute's Management that the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) would continue to support such partnerships in compliance with the Nigerian Content Development Act.

He stated that the Petroleum Training Institute has made considerable progress in developmental projects and academic excellence. The restructuring of the academic curriculum of the Institute which is in tandem with current trends in the Oil and Gas Industry is yielding positive results. Also, the synergy with operators in the oil and gas sector has

developed appreciably.

Expressing satisfaction on the developmental strides in the Institute, he said, “I must commend Prof. Sunny Iyuke, the Principal & Chief Executive of the Petroleum Training Institute for his laudable efforts in repositioning the Institute. It is crystal clear that the Institute under his leadership has indeed metamorphosed and is being positioned to meet the ever growing needs of the Petroleum Industry”.

Mr. Ladan noted that the skills Acquisition Academy of the Institute has indeed attracted youths who intend to be trained in entrepreneurial skills from all over Nigeria. This is expected to provide gainful employment for the Nigerian youths and contribute to economic growth.

While thanking the two inhouse unions (NUPENG and PENGASSAN) for maintaining industrial peace and harmony, he appealed to them to continue to sustain the cordial relationship existing between them and the Management of the Institute. “The Governing Council will continue to support Management in ensuring that the welfare of members of staff is given priority”, he assured.

Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Principal & Chief Executive of PTI, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke said the Institute is on course towards becoming the hub of human capacity development, and contributing significantly to the Nigerian content in the Petroleum Industry.

He hinted that a total of 53 students and 356 others bagged Distinction and Upper Credit, while a total of 400 graduates were awarded National Diploma, 639 graduates with the Higher National Diploma and 47 graduates received the PTI General Welding Certificate.

Still on ongoing projects in the Institute, Prof. Iyuke averred, “I am delighted to inform you that the Academic Block which was undergoing renovation has been completed and handed over. The facilities at the Conference Center complex are under renovation to serve the Industry better and enhance staff performance”.

As part of the PTI hands-on training strategy, the Principal announced that the Institute's workshops and laboratories are receiving facelifts in conformity with the ISO 9001 Certification.

On the challenges confronting the Institute, Prof. Iyuke lamented that placement for the student's industrial

training has continued to be a challenge to the Institute. “The Petroleum Training Institute Students Industrial Work Experience is a prerequisite for the ND students to be admitted into the HND programme as stated in the SIWES and PTI Academic Standard Rules & Regulations. This exercise enables our students to acquire and develop the necessary skills required in the petroleum industry”, he stressed.

He appealed to IOCs and other operators in the petroleum industry to accept PTI students and avail them the opportunity to prove their worth.

Also speaking at the event, the President of PTI National Alumni Association, Mr. Uwedjojevwe Augustine pledged the continuous support of the Alumni to the Institute Management adding that PTI has remained the home that produces the golden brains in the oil and gas sector, hence the need to give the Institute Management all the necessary support needed to run the frontline institution.

According to him, $\\prime\\mathsf{P T I}$ has trained over $78%$ of all middle manpower currently engaged in different field of knowledge in the Petroleum industry, as I pledge the support of the PTI Alumni to ensure smooth running of the Institute, I therefore call on all stakeholders in the sector to rally support to the PTI to ensure it realizes its mandates without hindrances”.

Udemezue Onyinyechi

Concerned stakeholders have bemoaned what they described as dearth of technical education in the country, regretting that Nigeria as a country has missed the mark in terms of technical education.

Speaking during the 1st International Conference of the Institute of Non-Destructive Testing, Nigeria (INDTN), held at the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) Conference Centre Complex recently, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke, the Principal & Chief Executive of PTI posited that without giving technology its rightful place, Nigerian graduates may not compete favourably with their counterparts in the western world.

Prof. Iyuke while reiterating that technology rules the world, opined that Higher National Diploma (HND) and Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) graduates should not have the same curriculum with B.Sc. adding that, plans are on ground for the foremost oil Institute to start the award of Bachelor of Technology.

The Don who noted that the theme of the conference entitled, “Integrity of Infrastructure: Challenges and Opportunities” was very apt, reiterated that this is an era where there is so much of Infrastructural decay in the nation. I make bold to say that Non Destructive Testing (NDT) and Condition Monitoring have major role to play in rescuing the nation from the menace of infrastructural decay”.

According to him, “Our task therefore at this conference should focus on how the INDTN can work with stakeholders towards providing the impetus and the enabling environment for the growth of NDT and condition monitoring, practice and legislation. Also, towards creating a better infrastructure for our dear country”.

While charging members of the Institute not to relent on their resolve towards ensuring that the INDTN affairs remain in the front burner, Prof Iyuke recalled that until the advent of the INDTN, the NDT Centre in Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun has been the hallmark of all NDT matters in Nigeria and assured that PTI would continue to play the big brother role to INDTN.

Iyuke who advocated for proper equipment in the nation's tertiary institutions for the teaching of NDT courses, disclosed that the only Institute that has all the facilities needed in training capacity for NTD is PTI. “With support from Ministry of Labour and Nigerian Content Development Monitoring Board (NCDMB), PTI can do all the required training”, he assured.

Also speaking, the Director of Factory of the Federation, Dr. Ifeoma Anyanwutaku pointed out that INDTN is a professional Body that is very dear to the Federal Ministry of Labour and Productivity.

Dr. Anyanwutaku disclosed that the Ministry of Labour and Productivity is looking forward to a fruitful collaboration with INDTN. She stated that the Ministry has developed three regulations for safety of the work environment and two of the regulations, has made detailed provision that covers NDT practitioners in Nigeria.

According to her, “Our focus and aim is to ensure the provision and maintenance of safe and healthy work environment nationwide. We do appreciate that the adoption of NDT practice will end the catastrophe imminent in the country as INDTN promotes safety environment”.

Earlier in his welcome remarks, then INDTN President, Engr. Johnson Umukoro disclosed that Nigeria currently has no national NDT accredited qualification framework, adding that lack of funding, well-equipped and updated resources materials for work has constituted a barrier for the Institute.

Then President regretted that Nigeria was not in the world map of NDT, due to the absence of a coordinated institutions in the past. In his words, “As a nation, Nigeria lack adequate certified NDT personnel required to man its various industries, unlike some developed nations such as India, Britain, USA that boast of NDT personnel in their thousands. Besides, there are non-indigenous companies involved in the manufacturing of consumables for NDT applications in Nigeria”.

Continuing, “There are no accredited NDT equipment maintenance and calibration companies in Nigeria. There is high influx of foreign Level III personnel conducting certifications, most times not up to the required standard”.

On the way forward, then President said the Institute is gearing up towards engaging in a strategic drive to raise a number of well trained and certified NDT personnel, liaise with corporate bodies; government agencies to develop standards and promote the implementation of the best practices in Non-destructive Testing in Nigeria as well as promote research in NDT technology and practice as well as institute a national training and certified programs in NDT, accredited to international standard.

“Worthy of mention, the Institute conducted a level II training and certification recently in preparations for level III training and certification. The participants' performance was outstanding, he enthused.

He disclosed that the membership of the Institute is open to anyone or any company working in or having an interest in NDT, condition monitoring and materials testing in general.

Individual members range from students studying engineering, physics, metallurgy and a wide range of other related courses, practitioners in the industry, managers and research scientists amongst others. Company membership, comprises Corporate Members diverse range of industries: aerospace, power generation, oil & gas, petrochemicals, Polytechnics, Universities, as well as equipment manufacturers, providers of specialist services and consultancies to name but a few.

The Petroleum Training Institute, Effurun, the leading Oil and Gas Technological Institute in Africa, charged with the mandate of providing manpower required to drive the Oil and Gas industry has matriculated 1,896 Full-Time and Part-Time Students in a combined matriculation ceremony held recently at the Institute's Conference Centre Complex Effurun.

Speaking at the ceremony of the newly admitted students for the 2018/2019 academic session, the Principal & Chief Executive, Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke, charged the matriculating students to maintain the high academic and moral standard for which the Institute is known.

Prof. Iyuke urged the students to obey those vested with authority, study diligently, promote and enhance the Institute's image wherever they find themselves and never to bring the name of the Institute to disrepute.

Meanwhile, the Chief Executive disclosed that plans were underway to re-evaluate and add value to the Institute's programme, and in near future, award Bachelor of Technology degree (B. Tech) to its graduates as against the present Higher National Diploma (HND). The proposal Prof. Iyuke said has been approved by the PTI's Governing Council, and soon to the National University Commission (NUC) for approval.

Prof. Iyuke also pointed out that the Institute for 47 years of existence, has been the hub for petroleum expertise with a reputation for providing handson, high quality technical education in petroleum discipline for the oil and gas sector. He reiterated that PTI graduates were all making waves in their various fields, as there is no oil company in Nigeria without a PTI graduate.

He further urged the new students to be creative, innovative, resourceful, focused and to work hard to justify the confidence reposed in them; stressing that matriculation is not just fanfare, but a serious responsibility.

The Chief Executive stated that the choice of the newly matriculated students was not misplaced, as the Institute is well-equipped with state-ofthe- art facilities and a team of

The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), intends to seek collaboration with the Nigerian Navy Engineering College (NNEC), Sapele in the areas of training and manpower development.

The Institute's delegation led by the Director/Chief Coordinator of PTI Consultancy Services, Mrs. Hadiza T.S Momoh said that this visit was a followup on the earlier visit by the former to the latter facilities to fine tune areas of mutual benefit for both institutions.

She posited that the NNEC and PTI would benefit tremendously as a result of the similar trainings in both institutions. However, she said that PTI has an edge over NNEC by virtue of being stable in training competent technical and technological manpower for over four decades.

Earlier, Commandant DiriOnyeama, the Commanding Officer of the NNEC Sapele, disclosed that the College was established in 1979 in Port Harcourt, but started full operation at Sapele in the year 2000. The College, he said, basically trains for the Nigerian Navy as well as other foreign Bodies and Companies.

The College, according to the Commandant, handle purely Engineering training for which PTI was known, while stressing that as the Management of PTI tour her facilities, they would find areas where they could collaborate with the College.

In the words of Commandant Onyeama, “It would be nice to have these collaboration with PTI in terms of training and manpower development, we are proud to have PTI come to see what we have and do and we have a lot to also gain from PTI.

During the facility tour at the College, the PTI team visited the Basic Engineering, Marine Engineering, Weapon Electrical Engineering; Nuclear Biological Chemical Defense and Damage Control/Firefighting; the Automobile Mechanic, Computer and Driving Schools among others.

Continuing, Chief J. C. Gay said, the NBTC was established in 1959, as one of the pioneer vessel repair and chartering

As part of its expansion, the NBTC has decided to upgrade its facilities from chartering/marine logistics and ship building/repairs to skill and manpower development so as to get youths to be skillfully employed in various vocations, he submitted.

Responding, the Principal & Chief Executive who was represented by the Director and Chief Coordinator, PTI Consult, Mrs. Hadiza T. S. Momoh, thanked the Management of NBTC for the visit and said this partnership, when it comes on stream would open new vistas of employment opportunities for the Nigerian teaming youths and for the betterment of the country at large.

The Principal said, “Business all over the world do better when they collaborate with one another”, adding that there would be need for exchange of staff between both establishments to bridge the gap where one establishment is lagging.

To this end, he said the Institute is open to collaboration but would go back to its drawing board and come up with a winwin Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) that would benefit both Organisations.

“I will transform the Directorate, Apply Technology Basic Engineering Knowledge to Oil and Gas Sector ”– Engr. Ukwuaba, DOE

# Sir, congratulations on your well-deserved appointment as the new Director of Engineering. Tell us about yourself?

I am Engr. Samuel Ifeanyichukwu Ukwuaba, fellows of Nigeria Society of Engineers, Nigeria Institute of Mechanical Engineering, Automotive & Locomotive Engineers of Nigeria and Institute of Registered Administrative Managers of Nigeria. I am also a member of several Professional Societies in Nigeria.

Just recently, I was conferred as a ${}^{\\prime\\prime}{\\mathrm{J}}{\\mathsf{P}}^{\\prime\\prime}$ by the Delta State Government of Nigeria. I am also a knight in the Catholic Church. Here in PTI, I came in as a lecturer, I became Head of Department, I was a Head of Department for three terms 2001 – 2011 etc. I was made the Coordinator of

Procurement and General Services which I did for some months, and later found myself as the Acting Director of Engineering before I was confirmed as the substantive Director of Engineering.

# Please, tell us your vision and mission for the Directorate viz-a-viz the Institute?

In summary I will say that my vision for the Directorate is not different from the vision and mission of the Institute. I will work in partnership with the Management to achieve its goals. However, in order to distinguish this Directorate from any other one, my mission is to be the dream Directorate that will apply technology basic engineering knowledge to solving the problem of the oil and gas sector.

In solving the problems of the oil & gas sector for which the Institute was set up, what are some of the challenges you envisage in the Directorate hitherto to your appointment, and how do you intend to address them?

When you talk about challenges, one will first ask, what are we really doing so that if you say this is a challenge, you know it is a challenge in the right direction.

As an Academic Directorate our major job is to teach, examine and prepare results. In teaching and collating results we have little challenge there but in the global activities of the Directorate, some of my staff do not even have office, you also see an Assistant Director and

is because PTI supplies manpower for both upstream and downstream sector in the oil and gas industry. For example, Mechanical, Electrical & Petroleum Engineering are upstream based which carry out exploration, drilling and production.

PTI products are everywhere in the oil Industry. What I will do to improve on the gains of my predecessors is to ensure that our curriculum and training meet the oil industry requirements. We also conduct booster courses for the oil industry, train and re-train its personnel to meet their basic job specifications, since most of them who come for these courses are producing companies.

Deputy Director sharing the same office which is

not proper.

Though PTI still

remains the best in terms of

institutions in

Nigeria, but not $100%$ level. As for Directorate Institute Management relationship, the challenges are not there at all, this is because the Principal and Chief Executive, Prof. S.E. Iyuke is committed to taking PTI to the next level. So when we have our dreams, he supports us. Administratively, we have no challenge but in terms of practicals, office machines & office comfort, that is where we have little challenges.

As an Engineering/Chemical based institution what areas do you think you can improve on the gains of your predecessors? PTI is an engineering based institution. This

As the Director of Engineering, what machinery have you put in place with other sister agencies in the oil and gas industry to collaborate with PTI?

As the new

Director of

Engineering, I

convened a

meeting of the

Directorate Board made up of the Deputy Directors and Heads of Department where we agreed that apart from the effort Management is making to establish relationship with other sister agencies in the oil and gas sector, we on our own will do a parallel job since most of us know these operators. We also intend to create both formal and informal relationship where our Staff would get into the oil industry and have a first-hand knowledge of what they are doing and apply it in training. I have a committee working on this and very soon our result will be out.

In a technology driven society, the importance of collaboration cannot be overemphasized and considering the importance of technology where new Engineering courses are being introduced, what innovative courses do you intend to introduce in the Directorate of Engineering?

My team in the Directorate has been operating on a philosophy of team work and I believe in the people I am working with because they are all cooperating with me. We have looked at the operations of the oil industry and mapped out some courses that will enhance and increase PTI's participation in the development of the oil and gas sector.

In the Departments of Mechanical/Welding, we plan to introduce Corrosion and Material Engineering. Corrosion as you know is a big problem in the industry both upstream & downstream; and we intend to produce personnel that can handle these problems. We also aim to introduce 'Material and Ecology' courses that will handle some of these problems in the plant. Some pipes carry hot fluid, corrosive fluid, very cold fluid and material reacts differently to them. ${\\mathsf{S}}0,$ we want to introduce these courses and have a good knowledge of the material we use and recommend which one that will stand the test of time.

In Petroleum and Natural Gas Processing Department (PNGPD), we want to train people that will handle some derivatives of the downstream sector. The name of the refinery we have here in Warri is called Warri Refining & Petrochemical Company (WRPC) and the 'PC' there, means Petro-Chemical which also produces polymer, so we intend to run a Polymer Course in PTI which has been presented to Management for approval. If approved, it will enable us to produce competent manpower for our refineries.

In Petroleum Engineering, we are introducing a Geological course which will help us in upstream exploration. PTI is all about Petroleum and Allied Industry. Nigeria is also diversifying, and our mineral resources are being expanded. As a result, only Geological course will help us train manpower to meet these needs.

# Do you really think that the course content of Engineering in PTI can attract partnership with other players in the Industry?

Yes. However, it needs improvement. In July this year, I am going to invite some external stakeholders (industries) to critique some of the new courses we are about to mount. There is also a timeline for us to review the course contents which my team is already working on to reflect the oil industry Information Communication Technology (ICT), International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and certification for the allied industries. The essence of this is that, if our staff are not certified, they cannot certify other persons.

Therefore, my first step is to convince Management to encourage staff members to pursue certification, since that is the language of the oil industry. My timeline on this proposal having being presented to Management for processing is June 2020. As a member of a committee called “Partnership” we are developing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Nigerdock to build a modular refinery in the Institute. I am also a member of a team working on partnership with the Navy to partner with us in diving. I can also tell you that my committee has done its SWOT and GAP analysis and so expect to see more collaborations with industries and other institutions that will make PTI better.

![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/58f23815-a663-482f-9d72-77b29cc3d5cb/images/02ae7bdd975185c23f6af985f69857f9c620a1f165e842f0d33d64f5cef3c752.jpg)

In one of our recent visit to the Nigerian Navy Engineering College, Sapele, we found areas where PTI and the college can actually collaborate. As the new Director of Engineering, how do you intend to drive this process?

As a member of a committee working on partnership, my first assignment is to develop areas of collaboration between PTI and the Navy, the tour to that facility (Navy College) came out with its own result which I earlier mentioned would form our Strength, weakness, Opportunity and Threats (SWOT) or GAP analysis. And at the end of the day we would apply what we call Threats, Opportunities, Weakness and Strength (TOWS) to solving it.

I make bold to say that collaborations PTI would have with any Organisation, is collaboration with the Directorate of Engineering.

Having been saddled with the onus of managing other Departments in your Directorate, how do you intend to carry along the Heads of Department and other rank and file officers in achieving the Directorate of your dream?

I told you that the philosophy of this Directorate is teamwork. No matter how experienced I am, what I know is just a fraction, but when I assemble minds in this Directorate, we will achieve a lot.

As a Head of Mechanical Department for over six years, I employed the concept of team work and make my subordinates work happily by commending the effort put in achieving any task. My teamwork philosophy is trust-worthiness. My Deputy Directors, Assistant Directors, and staff are all very good and what is required at times is minimal supervision.

How do you intend to encourage Staff members in your Directorate who are pursuing career or certification courses in Engineering with limited budget?

The Principal/Chief Executive has already made me a coordinator of sourcing grants from different places, and we are about securing PTDF grant. We have a Committee where our attention is largely on National Diploma (ND) & Higher National Diploma (HND) certificates, so that they will upgrade themselves. And so, without necessarily looking for PTI funds to sponsor such things; I am already working on other places as the coordinator in getting grants and Principal has written a letter we are using to support our drives. At this stage, I would not want you to say how are you encouraging it, I am initiating it and it is my baby and would ensure I pursue it to a logical conclusion. I have about 34 staff that are interested in this grant. Most of these staff surf the net, come out with these companies and the next thing we do is to give them the necessary support. It is my duty to convince Management and advice on the number of staff that can go on such courses. All that we need is to rationalize the selection from the various Departments so as not to collapse the system because everybody wants to go.

As the new Director of Engineering, do you have any plan to retain outstanding students who have distinguished themselves academically to be recommended for employment in the Institute?

Well, employment has procedures and Nigeria is a place where everything is being politicized. Immediately you make it a law that the best student should be retained, the issue is which Department will produce it.

The idea is a laudable one which I would table before Management; however, it is the prerogative of the Management to take such decision.

hundred and ninety million Naira (N290, 000.00) as security/buffer fund.

According to Ogunyemi, “Let me reiterate what we already know that the more money we have, the more loan will be made available to members and hence the better dividend. Based on this, I want to appeal to our members to cultivate savings culture for the rainy day. I am also glad to inform you that in line with the existing policy of saving for the rainy day, the Society has saved N290m as our security/buffer fund”.

Continuing, he said, “It is hoped that the subsequent Management will continue to build this fund to $\\mathsf{N500m}$ as agreed by the General House with the Interim Management Committee (IMC). This will make our Society to remain stronger”, he enthused.

Engr. Ogunyemi assured that the CMPCS is waxing stronger despite the enduring harsh business operating environment in the country. He stated that within the financial year, the Cooperative balance sheet showed upward growth of Four Billion, Six hundred and fifty Million, six hundred and fifty-nine thousand, eight hundred and six Naira (4, 650,659,806) in 2018 as against four Billion, five hundred and thirty-eight million, seventy-five thousand, eight hundred and eighty-two Naira (4,538,075,882) in 2017 representing $2.5%$ growth.

Reeling out their achievements of the CMPCS in the last one year, he informed the Cooperators that after rigorous negotiation between the Developers and Management Committee members, the lingering Orhuhworun Estate crisis has been laid to rest. Adding that the Estate has been re-designed in line with modern trend, while infrastructure works would commence as soon as the cost per plot is concluded and conveyed to the subscribers.

One of the major success of the settlement agreement according to him, was that the Developers would use their funds to build while using the Bill of Quantity (BOQ) prepared by Edna

Emuakpeje & Co who represents the PTI Cooperative Society.

Meanwhile, the Cooperators after

cheered the

and adopted the

proposed name

“Unity Garden Estate” in place of

Orhuhworun Estate.

While speaking on the growths recorded within the financial year, Adamu urged Management Committee to learn from the mistake of their predecessors, “We can see growth in our income, we have all done pretty well. We all participated in ensuring this growth. I hope we will not make our previous mistakes”, he advised.

Earlier in his welcome remarks, the Chairman of the occasion, Mr. Aliyu Adamu commended the Management Committee for righting the wrongs of the previous administration as well as pursuing human friendly policies.

The highpoint of the 18th AGM was a vote confidence passed on the Engr. Ogunyemi led Management Committee as they were unanimously returned for a second term in office.

the conceptualization and actualization of the project from past Co-operative Executives to the present one.

Prof. Iyuke recalled that on assumption of office 3 years ago, the CMPCS immediate past President, Mr. Peter Brown Agbude (retd.) called on him to perform the foundation laying and today he was also pleased to commission the edifice to the Glory of God.

The Principal and Chief Executive while citing an example of a patient with cancer, said “if the Institute is the patient, and the CMPCS the cancer, where the host dies, the cancer would also die, but in the event where both cooperate to kill the disease, there is no way the disease would survive”. These suffices to say that the cooperative society was no longer a cancer to the Institute but the duo now enjoy a symbiotic relationship, Prof. Iyuke enthused.

Concluding, he thanked the present Executive for giving him hope while praying that the

cooperation, collaboration and partnership between PTI and CMPCS be sustained for the growth and development of the Institute.

Earlier, the President of the PTI CMPCS, Engr. E. Ogunyemi in his speech, thanked the Principal & Chief Executive and his Management team for their magnanimity in providing the piece of land for the Co-operative to build and for supporting them all the way to its completion.

The CMPCS President reserved special praise for the Management Committee that supervised the project and the contractors for making judicious use of the money appropriated for the project.

The newly commissioned PTI CMPCS edifice has six rooms, two large stores for storage of goods, one showroom store, a reception room, one conference room and a big office space for committee members, one Security/Drivers apartment and a generator house amongst others.

– Oyetunde, Director R & D

Congratulations on your recent appointment as the Director of Research & Development. Can you tell us about yourself, educational background and achievements up till your appointment as Director of Research & Development?

My name is Oyetunde, Bamidele Sunday. I attended Christ's School, Ado-Ekiti; I later proceeded to University of Ile-Ife, now known as Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, where I had a degree in Mathematics, second class upper in 1987. I obtained

Postgraduate Diploma in

Computer Science in 1995 from University of Benin. I equally had Master of Business Administration (MBA) in 1998 and M.Sc. in

Mathematics in 2003 from

University of Benin respectively, and a Doctorate degree in

Mathematics in 2007, also from the University of Benin.

I belong to various Professional Bodies, such as Member, Nigeria Mathematical Society (NMS), American Mathematical Society (AMS), Mathematical Association of

Nigeria (MAN), Nigeria

Association of Mathematical

Physics (NAMP); and Southern African Mathematical Science

Association (SAMSA). Also, I am a Member, Nigeria Computer

Society (NCS), Computer

Professionals of Nigeria (CPN), Information Technology

Association of Nigeria (ITAN),

I also worked briefly in research laboratory of the Institute of Oceanography, University of Delaware, Newark, USA, for some months before coming back to Nigeria.

I have been teaching Mathematics and Statistics for some time in PTI but now I am concentrating only in Mathematics courses. I was given the best PTI Lecturer award in 2005. I was also awarded the Chief Philip Asiodu Prize as the best student in the Masters of Business Administration 1995 in the Entrance Examination into the University of Benin.

Research is one of the bedrock of PTI Mission, what are your plans to rejig Research and Development?

Research and Development is a new Directorate that we are just building up. Be that as it may, to rejig the Directorate, we are going to improve on the research culture among Staff and Students. There is need for our Staff to have that culture of research activities and this we have started through the formation of cluster groups, research teams and student postal presentation (for final year students).

In summary, with “all the necessary support in place, I am determined to take the directorate to its zenith and make it a world-class.

Talking about funding, without funds you cannot do much. We are going to source for funds both locally and internationally to maximize our research output through products development. We are going to commercialize some of our products and publish some of our research works in reputable journals. We are also going to patent some of them to ensure that the important ones are documented. We are going to develop the research activities that will address the challenges in the oil and gas sector, and thinking of collaborating with R&D centers both in Nigeria and outside Nigeria so as to move faster.

We are also nursing the idea of getting a dedicated Research Laboratory to improve on our research works. Also, we will grow the number of research groups in the Institute, presently there are about ten. We intend to increase research activities as obtainable in other institutions and also encourage the full participation of

# As a renowned Mathematician, do you see your new role as a daunting task?

Well, I don't see it as that. A Mathematician is noted for analytical skills and analytical thinking, so most of the problems in Engineering and Sciences are solved through mathematical models.

So, as an applied Mathematician, I am exposed to various areas of the oil and gas exploration, statistics, data analysis, probability, distribution, exploration, horizontal drilling, etc. In the Petroleum Engineering, you do a lot of computer work and a lot of simulation that helps even in the prediction of risk analysis of the oil well, even in transportation through pipelines. ${\\mathsf{S}}0,$ in a nutshell, Mathematics and

Research are basically the same. I feel at home here.

As you assume mantle of leadership in the Directorate of Research and Development, what innovations do you intend to put in place to move the Directorate forward viz-a-viz the Institute, in the areas of breakthrough research; will there be a paradigm shift from your predecessors?

Part of my innovations are partnership and collaboration. You cannot do many of these things in isolation. We are thinking of partnering with other organizations. Staff motivation is another aspect, because if the staff are not motivated they won't be interested in research work and this will be done through Staff training. We will continue to talk to the Management about the Staff training.

Another strategy is Staff exchange. We should be able to exchange some of our staff with other Organisations in order to learn. Our Staff should be able to go on sabbatical if it can be embedded in our conditions of service as it is applicable to Universities. If our Staff have gone for Doctorate programmes, on completion they should be given a year sabbatical and postdoctoral fellowship. After the sabbatical the Staff should be able to come back and tell the Management what he or she has achieved.

We are also going to encourage Staff to pursue PostDoctorate programmes. Again, we will look at the work load of Academic Staff. I can tell you authoritatively that the Academic Staff are having excess workload. We will find a way to reduce it to enable them devote part of their time to research work.

Again, we are going to source for funds. The Directorate is just emerging and as a result, it requires a lot funds to carry out its functions. We may approach Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFUND) for assistance. Like what is obtainable in other schools, PTI does not benefit from TETFUND. Once we have adequate funding, training and certification and a lot other things will follow.

Speaking about paradigm shift, I want to build on what my predecessors have done. I will not say there will be total paradigm shift, I have to build on what I met on ground.

The Federal Government recently charged the Institute on groundbreaking research in modular refinery, gas flaring etc., how and when will you set the ball

Modular refinery, gas flaring, these are some of the common terminologies we do encounter on a daily basis. Crude oil refining, especially in simply compact unit is referred to as modular refinery.

end gas flaring for some time now but another deadline is 2020 which is not realizable. Nigeria is the sixth largest gas flaring country in the world and second in Africa after Algeria.

Well, with our Environmental Research team, we will see whatever we can do to partner and ensure we put an end to gas flaring. We are just starting and I can assure you that soon, we will bedeviling research in the oil and gas sector are local raw material substitution, the drilling fluid, oil spill, locally formulated lubricant among others. Manufacturing of Modular refinery for research work is what our team from PNGPD is working on currently. Reservoir and drilling engineering is another aspect of research we are working on. Those are some of the areas we have core issues. We need a lot of research activities to enable us assist the oil and gas Industry. We are also developing software that will solve some problems in the oil and gas Industry. Our team on Safety and Environment, Gas flaring and Climate are doing their best in conventional one, it can be moved from one location to another. Some of the importance are to promote peace in the Niger Delta, which is to create jobs for the youth, to complement the supply of petroleum products. Gas flaring is one of the major problems in the world, it consumes the useful waste, natural resources and produces harmful waste and the harmful waste have negative impact on the society such as cancer of the lungs among others. With our activities in the Environmental Research team, we are doing something about it. The Federal Government has said they will

come out with a blue print.

PTI is set up to develop Human Capital and carry out Research for the oil sector, in realization of this mandate, have you conducted a needs analysis of some major oil companies and to carry out a corresponding research that will address identified problems?

As I said, I am building on what my predecessors have done. Before I came on board, the Directorate have written to collaborate with sister agencies such as NCDMB, PTDF, NNPC, DPR, some are yet to respond but some have responded. But most of the challenges currently

this regard. “In all, we are doing our best though, we are not where we hope to be yet but we are definitely not where we used to be in terms of research”.

Do you really think that this collaboration will take care of needs analysis of the companies, and do you believe that these research proposals will attract research grants from these companies?

Well, it depends. If for instance the NCDMB is having R&D Unit, we expect that there should be a level of collaboration instead of duplication of activities. Though we have observed that most of the sister agencies have been excluding PTI from their

activities but we are doing all we can to get this corrected. If collaboration issue is settled with agencies, it would aid us in knowing more about their needs and how to tackle them. I believe collaboration will take care of the needs of the companies.

It was reported in the press that most developed countries would phase out automobiles using gasoline by 2040, which would drastically reduce demand for crude oil in international market, as part of your long term goal, what adaptive research in areas of alternative energy sources (Renewable Energy) are you looking at?

I do believe that the demand for crude oil may reduce but not completely. Vehicles across the globe ride on gasoline. Besides gasoline, there are other products that are associated with crude oil and that is why we cannot rule it out. The plastic industry make use of crude oil, asphalt bitumen which contribute about $3%,$ so gasoline is $44%$ of the extraction, the aviation fuel used for airplane and other aircraft contribute about $8%,$ so we are just focusing more on gasoline to drive our vehicle without looking at the usage of other crude. Lubricants, grease, residual fuel we cannot do away with them but we always talk about gasoline being phased out.

The alternative sources of energy we are advocating is wave and tidal energy. The wave has an advantage over the tidal energy. In wave energy, you can construct and put in any location in the ocean, it is transferrable but very expensive, while wind energy or biomass energy (burning of wood) but here we are doing more of biomass fuel, using live plants to convert to energy, but the argument now is when there are not enough for people to consume, how do we augment?. Now, other plants which are not consumable that can be used to convert to energy are discovered. But don't forget that, if we are talking of wave energy, you have Come what “may, crude oil will still be relevant in the future. “to be close to the ocean, even hydro power, unless the source of the hydro is there, then nuclear power but if anything goes wrong, the effect is catastrophe. I know we have Nigerian Nuclear Regulatory Agency (NNRA) to handle that but I must tell you that it is still farfetched when it comes to alternative energy across the globe.

Come what may, crude oil will still be relevant in the future. Like some of the energy, the

equipment used to extract the energy still emit gas, only to discover you are spending more. In the bid to solve a problem, you end up creating more problems.

Research and Development require huge capital outlay; what budget is allocated to R&D in the Institute and what do you think should be the realistic budget for the R&D to perform optimally? And to be frank sir, do you think that this budget is realistic? And if we want to leave a legacy in PTI, what should be the realistic budget to keep the Directorate afloat?

For now, we do not have a dedicated budget for R&D but we have budget for training. So if we want to spend, the Institute will look at the budget for training and disburse to us. However, we are making sure that the R&D is embedded in the Institute's budget. To be modest, I will say 20 million Naira as a start-off budget will be ideal. This is to encourage our researchers and as time goes on when we start building research laboratories and do other things, the budget will go up reasonably. The Chief Executive has been emphasizing on the need for us to write proposals to attract funding.

Is there a way the Staff have been trained on how to write Research Proposals?

Yes. To be precise, last year we organized a two-day Research Proposal Writing seminar for all Academic Staff at the PTI Conference Centre Complex. It was a huge success and we are still going to revisit it soon.

What challenges do you envisage that may hinder you from realizing your goals?

As we have been saying, poor funding and Staff training. The funding will encourage Staff. If there is money, we will be able to do things and also account for what the monies were used for.

Can you tell us the most challenging project(s) you have worked on? What challenges are you looking at in this new role as Research Director? In your opinion, which is a better approach: working quickly to develop a good solution or taking more time to craft an excellent solution?

The most challenging project I have embarked upon was when I was the coordinator in Computer Centre in 2001. We were mandated to train DPR Staff on ICT and ICT then was just evolving. The training took almost a year in 2001 and the intermediate took another one year in 2002/2003, as most of the DPR Staff were grouped and we were going there to teach them, besides my teaching job. It was a serious challenge then because internet facilities were just coming up coupled with poor funding.

Another arduous challenge was the migration of the Institute to online platform in 2011 under Mrs. Dennar regime. It was a serious challenge. Before then, most of our application and registration were manually done but she gave the directive that it must be online. So to get the platform with the collaboration of other Staff was a very serious challenge and up till now there are still some challenges as per the software that will compute the result as well as transcript.

To me, working quickly but together to develop a good solution is better because a teamwork will always proffer a good solution.

What welfare packages do you plan for Staff in your Directorate who desire to pursue a career or certificate courses?

One of the welfare packages is sponsorship for training programmes. As many of them that are interested in training programmes should be encouraged. Over the years some of us have benefitted from the same system, so they too should benefit. If you are trained, you will not remain the same. All it requires is just a little push.

Another welfare package is the creation of an enabling environment, good office accommodation for Staff. A situation whereby four Staff are packed in a room is very discouraging, they would not have time to concentrate and give their best. I must commend the effort of the Institute's Management for stabilizing our electricity and the ongoing renovations in the Institute.

Assuming a new office in any organization is known to be somewhat challenging especially in areas of hostility

among staff. What strategies do you propose to adopt in

order to foster a harmonious working environment to boost work efficiency and

productivity?

First and foremost, all workers should be treated with dignity and respect no matter the level of the staff. No worker should be subjected to harassment either through religious belief, political or ethnic affiliation, all workers should be treated equally. Thank God PTI is a like a mini Nigeria, we have people from all geopolitical zones, no staff should be underrated. Always acknowledge little things, sparse achievements of staff should be encouraged. It is always good to say “thank you” if somebody has done something for you because it will go a long way to encourage the staff to do more.

Also, as a leader you should avoid idle gossiping and also encourage team spirit among staff and they should not do things in isolation. I should be able to offer help to my subordinates and colleague when they are in need and share in their pain. Render help to them and not intimidate them. Run an open door policy. If they have complain, they should come to me to express their minds and we should also be able to socialize outside as no man is an island.

# How do you relax?

I love watching African Magic Yoruba, news channels such as TVC, NTA etc. Occasionally, I do visit the Staff Club for relaxation.

# Your Thanksgiving Must Be Accompanied With Substance - Oritsejafor

Onyinyechi Udemezue & Precious Oroghwarejighe (IT) Student The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) Christian Community has been charged to always present their thanksgiving to God with a substance, as thanksgiving accompanied with a tangible gift triggers grace and unexpected help from God.

Giving the charge at the 2018 PTI End of the year Thanksgiving /Carol Service and Send off of retired staff members of the Petroleum Industry Christian Fellowship International (PICFI) PTI Chapter, the guest speaker, the Senior Pastor of Word of Life Bible Church, Pastor Ayo Oritsejafor, said Christians should understand that thanksgiving without a substance is likened to 'a car without fuel'.

accompanied with a worthy gift”.

Quoting the Bible book of Philippians chapter 4 verse 6, Pastor Oritsejafor charged the congregation not to add anxiety to their burdens while praying as God is not necessarily moved by tears but heart of thanksgiving.

According to him, “There are many unanswered prayers at the gate of heaven because of anxiety and lack of thanksgiving. Learn how to give thanks ahead of time, give thanks to God before presenting your needs. You must know that thanksgiving is the power behind the power and must be

Hi Admin good morning, I was helping my brother to fill his application form but the on logging in several hours later because it took time before the school can approve the payment of form. When I logged in after approval of payment it was showing another persons details on his portal and I can not change the details anymore. Please kindly get back to me on rectifying the error…

The Petroleum Training Institute.

(PTI) prides itself as the leading

technological Institute for the development of high-end technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector.

Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas personnel to meet the challenges of their companies especially, in this competitive business environment. The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry. As you peruse through the training brochure,

# PTI Leading in Hightech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector

we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company. At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.

PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

# Mini LNG Plant

# Objective:

This project is deeply motivated by the National strategic drive to leverage the nation’s abundant gas resource as the transition fuel of choice in addressing the multifaceted global warming challenges faced by Nigeria while meeting her national obligations towards the global energy utilization/emissions reduction targets aimed at the rising global warming crises.

Fundamental to which requires a National strategy to develop both the energy transition technologies and competent know-hows needed to sustain efficient utilization of energy and hence the role of the PTI in providing the leading platform for up-to-date hands-on manpower experience necessary to grow both in quantum and quality technicians and technologists with certified depth of on-the-job experience for the execution of such a lofty national aspiration.

This facility therefore is to provide the Institute Graduates with on-the-job (OJT) training environment requisite for the deepening of suitable manpower capabilities for the attainment of these global targets in energy utilization, reduction of global warming and predictable environmental controls.

Action Plan: In order to provide an end-to-end fitting solution to meet the above stated aspiration, the Institute intends to acquire the full installation of a 200 metric Tons/day LNG Production plant through its PPP initiative dedicated to stemming the attendant monetary losses to the waste of associated/flared gas in most fields and stranded gas fields which the project intends to monetize by liquifying same to finished LNG and distributed within the existing local LNG market potentials by also collaborating through the PPP arrangement with potential off-takers in the downstream sector.

# Prospects:

The prospect of this initiative will immediately accrue considerable savings to the potential primary asset holding company partners to the project through the elimination or significant reduction of flaring operational cost and outright elimination of flare penalties paid before the intervention of the proposed initiative. Additionally, it brings to a halt the total waste of the flared gas resource and replaces same with monetization of the flared gas value in a commercial term that ultimately will provide financial dividends to both the Institute and the primary gas asset partners, on one hand and the potential downstream off-taker partners on the other.

The strategic game-changer in all of this is the fact that the Institute’s Graduates will have an unrivaled study environment to propel their grit and hold on the right skill set needed for a sustainable development of the Oil and Gas industry.

# The PTI International Convention and Exposition Centre.

Objective: In order to fill the void of a suitable convention and exhibition infrastructure in the entire breath of the oil industry operation area and the growing desire of the oil and gas industry to positively remain in touch with global best industrial practices by advancing and expanding the potentials of the Nigerian oil and gas industry through myriads of oil and gas conventions and expositions, it is imperative for the industry to enjoy a befitting bestin- kind infrastructure of such magnitude to attract vibrant, needed international oil and gas players and other participants.

Action Plan: A befitting and deliberately intended facility of such nature hosted by the PTI will provide the needed ability to fill the void above and etch the institute in the core of the industry’s operations and processes in a much more defining manner of sustainability.

The proposed infrastructure in order to meet the target of a best –in –kind facility must aim at the highest international standards while uniquely inter -web with the local, socio-cultural dynamics of both the industry and the host community and serve the greatest utility of national interest.

The complex, which shall be a smart complex should boast of the following; a magnificent convention and exposition pavilion ground floor, a shopping complex/ business floor, multi-level basement parking, hospitality support, utility towers to serve for syndicate rooms and office space for the institute, multi-level rental spaces for oil and gas operators as offices and potential space for tertiary health care /diagnosis centre with ancillary utilities support (electrical, mechanical, etc.)

The convention centre is proposed to be largest multipurpose conference centre in Nigeria with a maximum floor space of 15000sqm. The facility will provide a 5000-dinner and conference event capacity, 500 exhibition booths and concert with audiences of up to 10,000 people. The hall will be a large single open facility, capable of flexible movable partitions into, up to 10 halls, and will have 10 built-in smaller conference rooms, 50 staff offices tower building and 3000sqm let-able spaces to accommodate banks, supermarkets and shops in the pavilion. The prestigious convention centre will have a three-tower rising above the convention pavilion to house all service functions described above and a 5-star luxury hotel with 400 rooms, 6 international restaurants, gymnasium, outdoor garden, swimming pool, salon and spa, business centre and a 1200-car parking space.

Prospects: An infrastructure of this nature when delivered shall provide the institute an unparalleled visibility and acceptance which will undoubtedly promote business with the institute and earn tremendous amounts of revenue for the institute and potential investors. Potential enhancement of this project significance lies in the on-going and upcoming massive infrastructural developments, particularly in transportation and energy envisaged in the Niger Delta region such as the Warri deep sea port, the nodal network of rail in the Warri corridor (Lagos-Calabar rail line, Warri-Abuja rail line), the existing airport facility around which the Institute enjoys availability of large expanse of land and the potential massive surge of stable energy seeking industrial spin-offs, at the behest of the anticipated phenomenal infrastructure growth within the Niger Delta Region are strong promoting indicators for viability of the project.

# Proposed Flagship Event:

Focus on: Africa Energy Agenda

Promoters: This can be co-promoted by a combination of OPEC, APO, AfDB and AfCTA, NNPC, NIPC, MPR and themes focused around;

\\* Evolving Africa Energy Ecosystem and Driving Development of the New Global Business and Growth Frontier

# Modular Refinery

(Condensate)(OJT Facility)

Objective: Nigeria is one of the largest crude oil producers in Africa with recorded crude oil production of 1,776,000 barrels/day as at January 2020. However, almost all the fuel products consumed in the country are imported due to inadequate refining facilities. In 2018, Nigeria imported 4.37 billion litres of PMS, 872.72million litres of AGO (diesel oil), and 312.71million litres of household kerosene according to National Bureau of Statistics. This is indeed a very disturbing situation for a country with a population of about 200 million people and already battling with high rate of unemployment.

![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/a933d378826c45f14696bcba58b9a9a859a2c210c6693edfdb4be7ed574ad9de.jpg)

[https://images.app.goo.gl/xcvNJPgypnH8kKNG9](https://images.app.goo.gl/xcvNJPgypnH8kKNG9)

The ministry of petroleum resources in an effort to address this problem with the 7BIG WINS agenda, under which short and long terms plans were developed to increase the local refining capacity and gradually attain self-sufficiency in terms of petroleum fuel products supply, aimed at ensuring amongst others; to review, optimize and promote the development of modular refineries in Nigeria.

This led to the Petroleum Training Institute being in the fore front in the area of training and technological development spear heading this work of developing an indigenous technology for modular refinery in Nigeria to serve as both an OJT facility and revenue generation initiative.

# Action Plan:

Nigeria produces about 2 million barrels of crude oil per day, exports all and import refined products, hence the urgency of the need to evolve practical home grown solutions such as the development and deployment of home grown designed modular refineries by the PTI as a panacea to the energy security crisis. The scope of action is scheduled for a 24 month design, procurement process, fabrication/erection/ construction and commissioning of a prototype design and a 500 barrel scale up modular refinery.

Prospects: As conceived, the modular refinery when completed will present the industry with an outstanding world-class training facility in the West African sub –region, with the compelling attraction for expertise training and know-how in refining and petrochemical operations and therefore promoting PTI as a hub of OJT and also attracting business interests from operators, contractors, consultancy requisite for oil and gas production outfits.

# Dive Centre of Excellence

![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/d6516df5-9c3f-4306-bb41-e68909d758a0/images/a531b7b1c28dec0d9e11d7d16fb2c40a6dc302dc3d9028a888fbeae6153ec53e.jpg)

Objective: Being a critical asset to the institute, the diving centre as conceived is a priority PPP project in order to guarantee its long term sustainability, increase revenue generation and value addition. Action Plan: The action for achieving the objective in this regard is to conceive and conceptualize a PPP business model appropriate to the size and significance of the investment such as a Joint Venture $(\\mathsf{J V})$ arrangement for its management and control.

Prospects: As conceived, the diving centre when completed will present the industry with a most outstanding world-class training facility in the West African sub –region ,with the compelling attraction for expertise training and know-how in deep offshore operations and therefore promoting a hub of commercial and business interests from operators, contractors, consultancy requisite for oil and gas production.

technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has
developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic
needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to
improve the eciency of key operations in the industry.
As you peruse through the training brochure, we have
designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of
the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the
workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually
(online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to
address the specific need of a company.
At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing
competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery
at optimal cost.
PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil
and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival
any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

# The Petroleum Training Institute.

(PTI) prides itself as the leading

technological Institute for the development of high-end technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector.

Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas personnel to meet the challenges of their companies especially, in this competitive business environment. The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry. As you peruse through the training brochure,

# PTI Leading in Hightech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector

we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company. At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.

PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

 content: # Amb. Ella Seeks for Consolidation of PTI Mandate

The Permanent Secretary of the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources (MPR), Amb. Nicholas Agbo Ella has called for a consolidation of the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) mandate, adding that the foremost Oil and Gas Institute in Africa has all it takes to train and retrain the required personnel in the sector.

Speaking over the weekend in Effurun while on a working visit to the Institute, the MPR Permanent Secretary said, “We must consolidate on achieving the full potential in the Institute instead of creating another petroleum institute. I feel very proud that we have an Institute like this. I have said it earlier and I will reiterate that, we cannot have Petroleum Training Institute of this magnitude in Nigeria and fail to utilize it”.

While lamenting the huge loss of revenue incurred on foreign training, Amb. Ella stated that, “Training is essential for all of us as individuals and as an organization. We should be able to develop ourselves and our capacities as well as enhance our productivities. PTI has all it takes to train all oil workers in Nigeria and I don’t see why we cannot train locally in PTI and save our scarce resources”.

Speaking further, he opined that, “I have told our colleagues in the sector that we must patronize the Petroleum Training Institute. At the Ministry level, we will push up the level of collaboration we desire. This is achievable if we unite and work as a team. We will speak with GMD of Nigeria National Petroleum Cooperation (NNPC) and other sister agencies in the Ministry. PTI need to move beyond where it is presently. This is the only Petroleum Training Institute we have in the country and we will not allow it to fail in discharging its responsibility”.

It would be recalled that there was a recent move by the current National Assembly to establish another Petroleum Training Institute in Ibeno, Akwa Ibom State. The MPR Permanent Secretary stated that there is no need for it. He declared that” We should rather channel the resources to PTI Effurun and turn it around, so that it can perform better”. He further stated that “We don’t need to establish any other institution of this nature in Nigeria. We should work harder to enhance what we have here by improving the capacity of the personnel”.

He suggested that, “If people find it difficult to come down to Effurun for the training, we can actually conduct the training at the Public Service Institute in Abuja under the umbrella of PTI. PTI Certification is recognized globally, so why will I go and train my personnels in a lesser institution outside the country when we have a better and well-equipped organization that can handle such trainings locally with just a little resource. Let’s work together to give maximum cooperation to the Management of PTI”.

Speaking on the purpose of his visit to the Institute, the Permanent Secretary said, “My main visit today is firstly to encourage the acting Principal Chief Executive, Engr. Dr. Samuel E. Onoji and the entire members of staff to pursue professionalism, because, with that, they will be able to be on top of their game in the development of the oil and gas industry.

“Secondly, I am here to encourage the Institute Management, to create room for inclusion in other programs of studies outside what they are currently doing. The energy sector is your primary domain, we want you to push harder to develop other competencies”.

“The Institute as you are all aware is the heart of research for the oil and gas sector of the economy. PTI is a reputed citadel of all technological knowledge and we will continue to give it all the necessary support it deserves. I want to assure you today that the two Ministers of State Petroleum Resources (Oil) and (Gas) have shown great interest and commitment in the repositioning of PTI and I sincerely call on all Nigerians especially, the policy makers to look inward to harness the potential of the Institute”.

On lack of patronage of sister agencies, he promised to continue to engage the President and other stakeholders on the issue adding, “We will continue to give you all the necessary support. The facilities of the Institute are delipidating, we will continue to engage. We will explore all options going forward, we will find a way to attract international support for the Institute”. While commending the Institute Management for what they have done over the years, he prayed for a well-positioned Institute. In his word, “We look forward to seeing a better PTI in the coming years.

“We will continue to lobby the National Assemble for adequate funding for the Institute. There is need to fund the petroleum industry, we are looking for a way to draw international attention. I am currently championing the establishment of African Energy Bank, when this is achieved, it will enhance our work in research & development and investment in the oil and gas industry”, he disclosed.

The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) prides itself as the
leading technological Institute for the development of high-
end technical human capital for the nation's oil and gas
sector.
Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas
personnel to meet the challenges of their companies
especially, in this competitive business environment. The
global oil market gas been massively impeded by the
COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the
global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much
pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a
result, most companies are developing cost eective
technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has
developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic
needs of the oil & gas and allied companies; as well as to
improve the eciency of key operations in the industry.
As you peruse through the training brochure, we have
designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of
the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the
workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually
(online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to
address the specific need of a company.
At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing
competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery
at optimal cost.
PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil
and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival
any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

# PTI Leading in High-tech Manpower Development in the Oil & Gas Sector

The Petroleum Training Institute (PTI) prides itself as the leading technological Institute for the development of high-end technical human capital for the nation’s oil and gas sector.

Over the years, the PTI has been tooling oil and gas personnel to meet the challenges of their companies especially, in this competitive business environment. The global oil market gas been massively impeded by the COVID-19 pandemic breakout, crashing oil prices at the global market to the lowest ebb. This, no doubt put so much pressure on the operating cost of businesses; and as a result, most companies are developing cost effective technology to stay afloat in business. To this end, PTI has developed courses to tool oil personnel to meet the strategic needs of the oil $&$ gas and allied companies; as well as to improve the efficiency of key operations in the industry.

As you peruse through the training brochure, we have designed courses that cut across spectrum of operations of the oil and gas sector. The courses can be delivered at the workplace, Petroleum Training Institute and virtually (online). Also, the courses can be tailor made on demand to address the specific need of a company.

At PTI, we put our heart, soul and vision into developing competent technical manpower for Quality Service Delivery at optimal cost.

PTI is prepared to collaborate with stakeholders in the oil and gas sector to develop high-tech personnel that can rival any in the Sub- Saharan Africa.

This is to inform candidates that applied for National Diploma (ND) Full Time programmes for the 2020/2021 Academic Session to please check their admission status in order to process their registration, if successful. Kindly note that the admissions portal is now activated to enable successful applicants commence the process of paying for acceptance and tuition fees. Please note that failure to commence this registration process within two weeks of the date of this mail, means that your admission would be withdrawn.

In addition, candidates who are yet to upload their results on the JAMB platform are strongly advised to do so. Please note strongly that those who are also yet to choose PTI as their institution of first choice and/or those who have not changed their preferred course to the course offered to them by PTI would not be processed for registration.

### Dr.(Mrs) Tina O. Isichei

Director of Research & Development

Dr. Tina Isichei graduated as one of the best in her class before her 19th birthday with a B.Sc Industrial Chemistry from the University of Benin in 1986. She later went back to her alma mater for her M.Sc. in Industrial Chemistry (1999) and later a Ph.D. in Environmental/ Analytical Chemistry (2012).

She started her career with the Savannah Sugar Company Limited in Numan, Adamawa State in 1986 as a youth corps member, and later worked as a Laboratory Technologist till 1992 when she voluntarily resigned her appointment and joined the services of the Petroleum Training Institute.

At PTI, she spent her first year at the Petroleum Analysis Laboratory, before moving to the General Studies Department where she taught Foundational Chemistry. She was later posted to the Industrial Safety & Environmental Technology Department where she taught courses in Environmental Chemistry for several years. Her last posting as a teaching staff was to the Science Laboratory Technology Department as one of the pioneer staff.

Her PhD thesis was on product development from the Water hyacinth — a perennial weed constituting a nuisance and hazard in many parts of Nigeria, especially the Niger Delta area, and across the globe. She is a firm advocate for the circular economy — passionate about developing products from waste materials as she believes that every waste material has an intrinsic value. As an academic, she has published papers in national and international journals and has attended and presented papers in local and international conferences. She is also a reviewer for many international journals.

Her contributions and roles in the institute include E- learning Coordinator, pioneer member of the QMS team that drafted the Institute’s quality policy, leader of the research team on Raw Materials and Production chemicals for the petroleum industry among others. She recently led the team that delivered the PTI anthem to the institute. She has grown through the ranks in the Institute and was recently promoted/appointed as the Director of Science.

Dr Isichei is a highly sought-after speaker within and outside the Institute and in   professional and religious circles. She is a Fellow of the Chemical Society of Nigeria (CSN) and Institute of Chartered Chemists of Nigeria (ICCON), Member of American Chemical Society (ACS), Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE) and Nigerian Environmental Society (NES). Dr Isichei is happily married with children and is passionate about mentoring teenagers, youths and women to maximize their full potentials.

# Celebrates 50yrs of Unprecedented Achievemen

ny to celebrate the institute.The vision of thefoundingfathersof PTI was to address the inadequacy of theindigenousrequirements tomanandoperateanefficient petroleum industry.

"This is not just in way they conduct business.Even in respect of technological changes, no one can tell you with certainty what will happen in the next 10 years.There's rapid change in the business environment andrapid change in choices,”he explained.

Mr.MeleKyari alsocalled for more funding for PTl, saying "For the Institute to play the role expectedofitinthefuture,alot of financing is required. He therefore urgedoperatorstoprovidemore fundingsupport for theInstitute.

On his part, Country Chair, Shell Companies in Nigeria, Mr. Osagie Okunbor noted that the industry has had to rely a lot on the manpower trained at the PTI for the growth of the sector.

He howeverpointed out that while oil and gas will continue to form a major part of the global energy mixin the next few decades, the ratio would gradually fall as the world focuses on other energy sources.

Osagie while commending the Institute for filling the gap of manpowerrequirementinthe oil andgas industry in thelast50 years;hecalledon theInstituteto be moreinnovative and proactive for the challenges occasioned by the global energy transition.

In his speech, Principal and Chief Executive, PTI, Dr. Henry Adimula disclosed that theInstitutewhichwasfoundedin1972 has trained over50,000 personnel for the industry.

According tohim,"The technologiest churned out by thePTI had become useful by operators, with out-of-country training reducing considerably. For instance, the Institute was largely responsible for the training of the take-off staff for theWarri Refinery and Petrochemical Company (WRPC), Kaduna Refinery and Petrochemical Company (KRPC), and Eleme Petrochemical CompanyLimited (EPCL),nowIndorama Petrochemical Company".

Adimula,maintained that Africa must not hasten to abandon fossil fuel,butshouldstrive to deepen research and development of local technologies to maximise exploitation andbenefitsofoiland gasendowments.

He said thecountryneeds toachievesomeindependence in the design and production of technology for the oil industry, aswell assourcefor alternative and renewable energy sources and off grid solar contraptions in anticipation of the global energy transition. Thus, he underscored the need for the Institute to engage inintensiveresearchand devel

opment effort to achieve theneed for independence in terms of local technology for oil production and local contentvisionof theFederal Government.

ThePTI ChiefExecutivenoted that going into the future, the Institutehopestobeattheforefront of developing manpower for modularrefineriesthatwould helpthe country to end theimportation of refined petroleumproducts.

"The PTI modular refinery whencompletedwillpresentthe industry with an outstanding worldclasstrainingfacilityin the West African sub-region, with the compellingattractionforexpertise training and know-how in refining andpetrochemicaloperations",he stated.

He disclosed that thecore function of the Institute includes training, research and consultancy services to the industry.

Dr.Adimula finally commended the effort and support of the Petroleum Technology DevelopmentFund(PTDF)forinfrastructure,facilitiesandhuman resources upgradeof theInstitute.

He stressed that the vast array of the state-of-art facilities procured for the Institute during the upgrade exercise has positioned PTI tobetheprime destinationfor oil and gas industry training in the whole of Sub-Saharan Africa.

# Anger Management

# Ziregbe Loveth Omagbemi

A nger is a strong feeling of annoyance, displeasure,or hostility. Sometimes, one could barely restrain his or her angerata comment.

The Holy Bible says in "Proverb 29:11" it's only a fool who gives full vent to his anger and the wise keeps it under control.

Adimula stated thatfrominceptionin1972till date,theInstitutehas graduatedwellover50thousand technologistsandtechniciansand othertechnicalpersonnelinvarious areasinoil andgasandalliedindustry operations.Headded thattheAlumni members can begleanednotonlyin Nigeriabut across the globeplaying majorrolesin the management and operationsintheoilandgasandallied industry.

Safety andEnvironmentthroughthe signingofmemorandum ofunderstandingwithInstituteofSafety Professionals of Nigeria(ISPON), amongothers".

Anger is a very sensitive and crucial issue that ought to be carefully handled and well managed, if not it can create a lot of misinterpretation and misconception. It can also create doctrines that may not be healthy for the society.Anger is an outward expression ofbottled-up offence of an inbuilt emotion,whichreacts to all forms of impulses of negative or positive emotion.Thoughts and feelings that can be stirred up by provocative words, and actions, inform of criticism, oppression, false accusation,gossip,betrayal,disobedi ence, disloyalty, and sometimes corruption.

By Onyinyechi Udemezue

Anger does not really have an explicit Definition and the symptoms may not be ascertained because, one man's boiling point, may be the freezing point of another man. However, anger is a vice that incubates other destructive vices. The spirit of angeristhedemonickeysthatbreak the hedge of protection. Even the Holy Scripture says, "Be ye angry and sin not".(Eph.4:26) and he that break the hedge a serpent shall bit. Anger creates

anxiety,

worries,and tensions etc., health wise,

whichhad accumulatedoverseveral years. It is an involuntary emotional reaction.Mosttimeswe considered anger as a normal reaction to“miscon ception about one's personality when all efforts to set the records straight to another person, seems abortive". Anger may not be totally a bad habit, but it may result in evil and destruction of life and property if not managed.

Angermaylead touncontrollable action, and the consequences could be destructive. The devil is still using the subtle device of anger to destroy families, churches, different organisations and the world in general today.

This article is geared towards the negative impact of anger in our homes, work place and even the society at large. Anger, when out of control negatively breed resentfulness, bitterness, hostility, enmity and destruction of lives and properties. Though not all angers are sinful or wrong at the initial time, but managing it can make the difference.

Ans:PTlisaParastatalof the MinistryofPetroleumResources.The Ministry of PetroleumResourceshas an oversightfunctionoftheInstitute andPTI also has its ownGoverning Council and if you check the enabling Actestablishing theInstitute,the Councilis there to oversee theday to dayrunningoftheInstitute and directlyrepresenting thecouncilis the Principal Chief Executive of the Institute.

# YouhaveworkedintheInstitutefor more than two decades,andyou are now the ChiefExecutive,how can youdescribeyourexperience?

Ans:Myexperience over heyears have been wonderful from day one. ThePTI environment isvery conducivethat anyonewillingtobuild a careerwill findhim orherself in an environmentyou canthrive.Ithink that isveryriticalbecause,some environment will stifleyoubut thePTI environmentallowsyoutodevelop and actualizeyourpotentials and I mustsaythatthisenvironment and communityhaveprovidedmewith such opportunities.

# What arethe challengesfacedasthe leaderoftheInstitute?

Ans:Themajor challenge is the abilitytokeepwithtrendsofthe sector,we are servicing the oil and gas industry and this isnot alocal industry,it is an international industry,andalso anindustry thatis heavily dependenton technology,this alsomeans thatyouneeda lotof investment everytimetocatchupwith the modern technology as they evolve. Funding hasbeen a challenge butwe trytomaximisewhatwehave and also inpartneringwithbodiesthatare able to assist us in funding.So,to an extent, wehavebeenabletoovercomesuch challenges andbecausealso of the critical nature of theindustry，he Institute is currently repositioning deliberatelytoaligncloselytothe needs of theoil andgasindustry today.Thegoal orobjectiveis for the Institute tobecomethe centreof Excellence as a traininghubfor oil and gasindustrynot just locallyinNigeria but of course,as you rightly noted earlier,ouroverallgoalandmarketis African continent.So,we are actively pushingthatandwebelievethatthe rewardswill come very soon.

Despiteyoureffort atworkinground theclocktoplacePTIasthe

pacesetter,someindustriesinthe

country still sought training overseas. How do you plan to arrest this capital flight?

Ans:It will not change in a day but we arechanging that and for instance looking at one of the biggest company todayinNigeria isthe Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) Company,it is aworld class company and every year this company recruit staff,Techniciansand Technologies and send them outside the Countryfor trainingbut recently, PTI had an opportunity and we pleaded for this training,they came inspected our facilities and gave us a contractfortrainingtheirtechnicians and today wecanproudly say that their staff havebeen trained here in ourfacilitiesand they arewell equipped togo andimprovetheir facilitythatis abigplusforus andit goesalongwaytoshowtotheworld thatifwecan do that,wecanactually do more.Recently too,we did a specialisedDiveMedicTechnician (DMT)lrainingwhich otherwise wouldhavebeen takenoutof this country.In partnershipwith a foreign body,20personnelwere trained and they all passed theexamination atthe first attempt.All these are pointers to thefactthatwecan achieve anddoso muchmorebybelieving inourselves asNigeria that all these things are possiblewith usand thewhole essence is towin thetrust of theindustry that, there is no point taking these trainings out of the country,with theright investment and theright support these trainingswill be delivered successfully hereinPTl.Andwehavedonealotof traininghereformany otheroil companies.So,wheneverthe opportunitycomesup,we areever ready,equipped andcapable to deliver.

# Many institutions have their financial issues'so if givenan opencheque whatdoyouwant theGovernment to doforyou(PTI)?

Ans:Funding is good but again, thequestion shouldbe,how dowe maximize the availablefunds.Yes, everybodywillnaturallywantmore fundbutwhenyouarefacedwithsuch challenges ofpaucity offundsbecause if youlook at the entire country,so manysectorsarecryingforfund and nosectorwould anydayhave it all.So, whatwedoistoreachout tothe industry，by showcasingwhat we are doingso thatif for instancethe countryspendsalotofmillionsof dollars every year training staff outsideof thecountry,imagineifwe are able to capture $50%$ of the training, wewill havemorethanenough to conduct our activities.So,our targetis to look at how we can take advantage of the challenges,improvewhat we do andwin therespect of theindustry so that they can domicile their training here in PTI.

# Given anopportunitySir,whatarea of thePIAwouldyou suggest amendment?bearing in mind the $3%$ forhostcommunities?

Ans:Webelieve that $3%$ assigned to thehost communityforthe development of thecommunityis a step in theright direction andis quite laudable.

# Butstakeholdersfeltthe $3%$ istoo meagrefortheCommunities?

Well,the $3%$ isbetter than nothing,so it is a very good one and I thinkwhatweshould dois tousethat $3%$ well so that bythe timeweuseit judiciously andpeopleseetheresults, thenwecanbe juslified to askformore or askforan amendment.

 content: # Uganda National Oil Company Seeks Collaboration with PTI For Manpower Training

A delegation of the Uganda National Oil Company (UNOC) led by Catherine Tumuaime on Tuesday, in collaboration with the Nigeria Content Development Management Board, NCDMB, visited the Petroleum Training Institute, PTI, Effurun Delta State, to finetune arrangements on how they can collaborate and work out modalities to strengthen the National building effort in the Oil and gas sector of the Uganda economy.

Tumuaime, the Head of the Uganda, delegation stated in her bilateral address that Uganda being a baby in the Oil and gas industry, they are in Nigeria which have come a long way in the oil industry. Tumuaime explained that they are in Nigeria to learn and grow in the Process as they truly want to benefit from the available National Content and Manpower Training Capacity and Research Potential domiciled in the Petroleum Training Institute PTI Effurun Delta State.

Tumuaime, the Chief Human Resource Officer (CHRO) of Uganda National Oil Company in her official Statement at the Council Chamber of the Petroleum Training Institute PTI during the visit, told the PTI Management Board that, they came to the Institute through the NCDMB to formalize the process of what need to be done for Uganda National Oil Company to qualify for a collaborative engagement in different sectors of the Oil and gas industry, adding that they have actually started a Petroleum Training Institute , but so far they are nowhere compared to what they have seen in PTI, hence they are eager and willing to learn.

The UNOC Human Resource boss explained that Nigeria being a long time Oil Producing nation with the relevant expertise, the Uganda National Oil Company want the collaboration with PTI to involve Training of their personnel so that the Ugandan People after the Training can go back home with the experience they gathered here in PTI to man their relatively new Petroleum industry in Uganda. Tumuaime, who stated that the collaborative effort will come to fruition by the grace of God, expressed optimism that with what she has seen in the Process of the visit, the Uganda delegation is in the right place to get proper guidance to grow their oil and gas potential for accelerated development of the East African nation.

Jessica Kyeyune, the National Coordinator of Uganda National Oil Company who also Spoke stated that the Uganda nation is interested in the collaboration in both upstream and downstream because already they have Projects going on at various level of construction. She stressed that they need collaboration with Nigeria through PTI to deepen their experience in the Petroleum industry. She said in her words: “UNOC want to follow the general practice of how Nigeria went through the ropes to get to where the nation is today in Oil and gas Production while we learn through the Process.”

She commended NCDMB for interfacing between Uganda National Oil Company and the Petroleum Training Institute in making the meeting a reality.

Tassalla Tersugh, the Head of the NCDMB delegation who represented Engr Felix Omatsola Ogbe, the Executive Secretary of the NCDMB in her goodwill message thanked PTI for hosting the very crucial bilateral meeting between the lnstitute and the Uganda National Oil Company for the purpose of benchmarking, knowledge sharing and collaboration in different sectors of the oil and gas industry.

# Part Time SICE Programmes

### School of Industrial Continuing Education (SICE)   Part Time (Weekend) Programme

The School of Industrial Continuing Education (S.I.C.E.) programme is the part-time study programme of the Petroleum Training Institute. As the name implies, it is geared towards making people working in the industries continue their education without breaking off from their jobs in the industry.

The programme came into existence due to the yearnings of the Oil, Gas and Allied Industries in Warri and its environs, to upgrade the capacity of their middle cadre manpower without disturbing their production.

Hitherto, most of the workers upgraded their technical knowledge through day releases from their companies or by shuttling. Day releases were at the expense of the Industry. Shuttling causes questionable practices at the workplace and in PTI.

As years went by, the SICE programmes stabilized in PTI and it metamorphosed to weekend programme to cater for students from far and wide.

The SICE programme has continuously and successfully run for  over twenty five years ( 1995-till date).  Many oil/gas and allied industries workers have benefited from the programme.

#### [Objectives of the SICE Programme](http://pti.edu.ng/part-time-sice-programmes/\#1471191075767-71032b6f-42fe)

The objectives of the SICE programme are in line with the PTI mission and vision and these are as follows:

1\. To foster the acquisition of technical knowledge by oil, gas and allied industries workers.

# Overview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry

Since the 1960s till date, the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry have continued to play a key role in the country’s economic growth and development.

In terms of structure, the industry is broadly divided into:

• Upstream sector,

• Downstream sector, and • Services sector.

However, a distinction now includes the Mid stream that covers the processing, storage, marketing and transportation of crude oil, gas, gas-to Liquids and liquefied natural gas.

# Overview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry- Upstream sector

This sector is characterized by exploration and production of crude oil and gas (petroleum operations). In terms of operation the up stream ector is arranged af follows:

Joint Venture: This is the standard agreement between the national oil company i.e the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and an international oil company (IOC).

Production Sharing Contracts: NNPC engages the IOC or the indigenous company as Contractor to conduct petroleum operations on behalf of itself and NNPC. The Contractor takes on the financing risk.

Service Contract: Under this model, the Contractor undertakes exploration, development and production activities for, and on behalf of, NNPC or the concession holder, at its own risk. Concession ownership remains entirely with the NNPC/holder, and the Contractor has no title to the oil produced.

Marginal Field Concession: The Federal Government (FG), in furtherance of its Nigerian Content agenda, encourages IOCs to surrender their marginal fields for

# Overview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry- Downstream Sector

Transmission and Conveyance: This involves the transportation of oil and gas to the refinery and gas stations.

Refining: Nigeria has four refineries: two situated in Port Harcourt and one each in Warri and Kaduna.

Distribution and Marketing: Distribution and Marketing of refined petroleum products are complementary activities. Distribution involves the transportation of refined petroleum products from the refineries through pipelines, coastal vessels, road trucks, rail wagon etc to the storage/sale depots.

Petroleum products are supplied in Nigeria principally through the Petroleum Product Marketing Company’s (PPMC) pipeline system, which links the refineries to the about 21 regional storage/sale depots.

Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG): Nigeria holds the largest natural gas reserves in Africa but has limited infrastructure in place to develop the sector. Nigeria’s first and most ambitious gas project, the Nigeria LNG (NLNG) facility on Bonny Island has six LNG trains currently operational with a total annual capacity of 31bcmIt has become an

Overview of the Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry- Oil Service Sector The classification of services under this sector is summarized as follows:

Seismic data acquisition Processing and interpretation logging, fishing, cementing welding services

# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry

The oil and gas industry is a complex and fascinating one. Its work sites are unique and few people have the privilege of viewing them up close.

There are three fundamental tasks in the industry: exploration (seismic operation); drilling and construction; and production, processing and offloading.

![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/42bd2bec-4fd4-4c2f-bae1-4cdb36151f11/images/11efc8352f15c4a72994bd997a3dd41a4f97454fde9280e5aa60a93446c36d02.jpg)

# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry--Drilling

Drilling: Once the geologist through seismic operations confirms the presence of hydrocarbon in an area (land or water), the designated spot is marked for drilling. Drilling an oil well is a massive project that involves teams of workers and specialists.

![](https://pti.edu.ng/tmp/42bd2bec-4fd4-4c2f-bae1-4cdb36151f11/images/2d9925a912f4176848cf2e43e0d0aaeb78980f7d51c592a91138c0ee4055953e.jpg)

# The Operational Phase of the Oil and Gas Industry- Production &Processing

Production is the extraction step: getting the oil or gas out of the ground and off the premises into a pipeline or cryogenic tank. In the early stages of production, the oil or gas (sometimes both) might flow of their own accord, but eventually engineers will have to coax it out—if injecting steam or gas under pressure can be called coaxing. Processing is the stage where the hydrocarbon mix goes through a number of processes to separate the various hydrocarbon fractions (roughly, gas from condensate from oils) and all from water. The processes take the fluid mixture—often at high temperature and pressure—through heat exchangers, valves, compressors and similar devices which deliver the separated components to different storage and offloading facilities.

# Relevance of Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Worker

The oil and gas industry is one of the most lucrative fields for employment.

Workers in this field of business generally receive sizeable salaries and numerous benefits, while at the same time enjoying frequent travel to distant locations and intellectually stimulating work.

However, while it is true that working in the oil and gas industry does offer numerous benefits, it’s important to remember that there are also many risks that come with a job in this field.

Because of these risks to health and safety, it becomes imperative for businesses to prepare their employees for the rigours of a job in the oil and gas industry.

Job description in the oil and gas industry are always evolving, as new technology and environmental regulation change the face of the industry and make having an educated and well-trained staff an industry imperative.

Education and training shouldn't end when the person is hired, however. Nothing stays static, and in today's ever-changing energy environment that is more the case than ever.

# Relevance of Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Worker

Effective training – i.e., by experienced energy professionals – can have a wideranging impact on the individual being trained, the company he or she works for, and the industry as a whole.

For individual employees, continuing to learn and develop their professional skills and expand their knowledge-base can open up opportunities for advancement in their companies.

Staying on top of best practices and growing on the job can insure that an employee will remain valuable to his or her employer.

Productive employees are any company's biggest asset, and when they leave, they take with them years of experience, knowledge and skill. It doesn't matter what the economy is like or what is happening in the industry, retaining the best performers is essential for the success of a company. Keeping them motivated is a key factor in that.

Investing in employees by providing them with opportunities to improve their skill level shows them their contributions are valued. That kind of investment in human capital will pay back in increased productiveness and a solid bottom line. Finally, a welltrained workforce contributes mightily to the entire industry, whose successes and failures can have a worldwide impact.

# Regulatory Framework Enhancing Local Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Industry

In the past, training and skill acquisition for industrial workers are hardly within the contemplation of investors and government.

Recently, there has been a rethink of the objectives of the investors and government actors in the industry, because of the spate of increase in industrial accidents resulting to impacts on humans and environment.

It is obvious that without sound national policies and management strategies, the Nation’s increasing scale of economic activity in coming decades and beyond would pose serious challenges for the Oil and Gas sector.

The basis of any law or regulation in Nigeria is contained in the 1999 Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Pursuant to section 20 of the Constitution, the State is empowered to protect and improve the environment and safeguard the water, air and land, forest and wildlife of Nigeria.

# The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act 2010 No. 2

The Nigerian Oil and Gas Industry Content Development Act (NOGICD 2010 Act) is an attempt by the government and stakeholders in the petroleum industry to ensure that the industry provides local value and maximized benefits to Nigerians.

Specifically, the ―Act‖ as addresses issues pertaining to: Employment; Social development; Security; Local currency; Encouragement of local and foreign investment; Promotion and Protection of local businesses/investments

Organize conferences, workshops, seminars, symposia, trainings, road shows and other public education fora to further the attainment of the goal of Patronage of local resources: human and material; Discouraging imports and encouraging exports.

Conduct studies, researches and investigations that may further the attainment of the goal of developing Nigerian content in the Nigerian oil and gas industry; Nigerian Content Division (NCD) of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)

In 2005, Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) established the Nigerian Content Division (NCD) policy to give a formal structure to Nigerian Content issues and significantly positioned the policy for more holistic application in the industry.

# The Thrust of the Nigerian Content Policy

The Nigerian Content Policy seeks to promote a framework that guarantees active participation of Nigerians in oil and gas activities without compromising standards.

The policy also focuses on the promotion of value addition in Nigeria through the utilization of local raw materials, products and services in order to stimulate growth of indigenous capacity.

The Federal Government is optimistic that its policy will result in steady measurable and sustainable growth of Nigerian Content throughout the oil

# Petroleum Technology Development Fund Act No 25 of 1973

The Petroleum technology Development Fund (PTDF) was established by Act No. 25 of 1973, which replaced the Gulf Oil Company Training Fund (Administration) Act, 1964 and vested in the Fund all the assets and responsibilities of the defunct Gulf Oil Company Training Fund.

Challenges Facing Training and Certification for the Oil and Gas Industry

Deficient infrastructural facilities for training

An improved educational infrastructure is needed.

Lack of adequate finance, insufficient pertinent technical expertise and unhelpful multi-national company’s attitude are impediments that should be removed.

Corruption and mismanagement or opaque accountability.

Unstable and even volatile political and economic environments in Nigeria.

Lack of appropriate training materials.

# PTI as a Destination of Choice for Training and Certification in Oil and Gas Industry

PTI since its existence has continued to take giant strides in meeting the objectives for which it was set up.

This is in the area of training the manpower needed to operate the essential sector of the Nigerian economy which is crude oil exploration, expliotation and processing.

PTI Consultancy offers job oriented training through short and booster courses to meet the specific needs of the Oil and Gas and Allied Industry. There are other units within the Consult such as the Petroleum Analysis Laboratory (PAL), Conference Centre Complex,

Printing Press

There is also the Computer Technology Centre. The Institute is the nexus of the Nigerian Institute of Welding, Centre for Non-Destructive Testing (NDT).

# CONCLUSION

The Oil and Gas Industry operate in a regulatory or legislative framework that sets standards for their continued operation.

This paper has revolved around the current situation concerning the legal and administrative framework as it concerns local training and certification in the oil and gas industry.

This paper underlines the concerns of the infective implementation of the relevant laws and policies and suggested that the destination of choice in competent training and certification in Oil and Gas Industry is the Petroleum Training Institute (PTI).

This paper recommends that the developed legal and regulatory framework should be fully addressed by the Nigerian government so as to promote proper and effective implementation of the Nigerian content policy which will aid in achieving industrial growth.

The Act establishing PTDF for example should be ammended to remove the word ―abroad‖ to encourage local development of manpower.

Dr. Henry A. Adimula has assumed office as the Acting Principal and Chief Executive of Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), Effurun, Delta State,

following the expiration of the first four years term of Prof. Sunny E. Iyuke on July 3, 2020. Until this new development, Dr. Henry Adimula was the Vice Principal of the Institute.

Prof. Iyuke while congratulating Dr. Adimula, wished him eventful tenure; adding that he should endeavour to complete all ongoing projects in the

Institute. Also, Prof. Iyuke paid glowing tribute to the Ministry of Petroleum Resources and the Institute’s Governing Council for the opportunity given him to serve the Institute in this capacity.

He egged on staff members to cooperate with the new Ag. Principal and Chief Executive to take PTI to the next level. Speaking further, he said, “I have forgiven those who offended me and to those I displeased should also forgive me”.

Brown A. Ukanefimoni,

Deputy Director, PAD

Dr. Henry Adebowale Adimula, **_FCSN, MICCON, MNACE, MPIN, MNES_** _,_ has been appointed the Principal and Chief Executive of Petroleum Training Institute (PTI), with effect from June 17, 2021, by the Institute’s Governing Council. Until his appointment, Dr. H. A. Adimula was the Institute’s acting Principal and Chief Executive from July 4, 2020 to June 17, 2021. He was also the former Vice Principal of the Institute, from December 4, 2019 to July 4, 2020.

Dr. Adimula had his university education at the University of Ilorin where he graduated with a B.Sc. Chemistry (1985) and M.Sc. (Chemistry) 1989 and the University of Benin, where he earned his Ph.D. in 2010, with specialization in the ‘Modifications and Applications of Biopolymers’.

In 1990, he was appointed by the National Institute for Freshwater Fisheries Technology, New-Bussa, Niger state and was immediately deployed to head the Chemistry department of the Federal College of Freshwater Fisheries Technology, a subsidiary of the Institute.

He joined the services of the Petroleum Training Institute in 1992, as a Lecturer II and has by virtue of his hard work and outstanding contributions to the progress and actualization of the objectives of the Institute rose to the headship of the Petroleum Training Institute.

Dr. H. A. Adimula has had a distinguished career at the PTI and has held various offices of high responsibilities. He served as Head, Department of Industrial Safety and Environmental Technology (ISET) between 2014 and 2017. As the head of the largest single Department in the Institute, he built a team of motivated staff, promoting and nurturing harmonious working relationships. In the middle of his tenure as Head of the Department, he was saddled with the higher responsibility of piloting the affairs of the newly established Directorate of Research and Development (R&D) as the pioneer Director in December, 2017. As Director of Research and Development, he established a 5-year plan for transforming the research culture of the Institute and created research clusters to address the various technological challenges of the oil and gas industry with a goal to developing home grown technology and to deepen the Nigerian content in the oil and gas industry.

He also served as the Director of Science from July 2018 to December 2019. As the Director of Science, he worked with the other Directors and top Management to formulate policies and the strategic directions for the Institute until he was appointed by the Governing Council of the Institute in December 2019, to occupy the vacant position of Vice Principal. As the Vice Principal, he was saddled with the responsibility of repositioning the Institute to better respond to the emerging trends in the oil and gas industry and leading the Institute to become a skills-certifying centre for the oil and gas industry in Nigeria. He served in this capacity until his appointment as the Ag. Principal in July 2020, and as the substantive Principal and Chief Executive on June 17, 2021. He has since then been embarking on projects and initiatives aimed at more closely aligning the Institute to solving the technological challenges and the training needs of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria in particular and the rest of the world.

Dr. Adimula is well respected for his research works seeking solutions to the problems of pollution of the environment by the Nigerian oil and gas industry. He is a two time winner of the PTDF Research Grant competition for his research to **_“Develop Immobilized Oil Degrading Microorganisms in Local Cellulosic Materials for Rapid Deployment in the Remediation of Oil Polluted Soils”_**. He has published in several respected academic journals and he is an active member of a number of professional societies where he has held several offices of responsibility.

Dr. Adimula is married and blessed with wonderful children. He’s a part-time pastor in the Redeemed Christian Church of God. He loves reading and contributing to building a better society.

# Sample Page

This is an example page. It’s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:

> Hi there! I’m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piña coladas. (And gettin’ caught in the rain.)

…or something like this:

> The XYZ Doohickey Company was founded in 1971, and has been providing quality doohickeys to the public ever since. Located in Gotham City, XYZ employs over 2,000 people and does all kinds of awesome things for the Gotham community.

As a new WordPress user, you should go to [your dashboard](https://pti.edu.ng/wp-admin/) to delete this page and create new pages for your content. Have fun!

I have a BSc in Microbiology and did not apply for pti. But I have a burning interest to pursue a HND course in PTI for Petroleum and Natural gas. Do I have to apply for the school in jamb, and start with ND before doing my HND as usual or does the school offer the opportunity for a Direct entry into HND with my BSc?

The following resolutions were reached at the Learning Mangers' Workshop of the Oil/Gas and Allied Companies and PTI Management which was hosted by the Petroleum Technology Development Fund (PTDF) at the PTDF Towers, Abuja on ${19^{\\mathrm{th}}}$ May,2016.

The workshop noted the following:

1. That the Learning Mangers Workshop provided a viable platform for sharing knowledge and ideas on the challenges confronting the Oil and Gas industry with a view to exploring viable solutions towards addressing these challenges.

2.That Nigeria was ranked as having the $9^{\\mathrm{th}}$ largest Gas reserves in the world having over One Hundred and Eighty-Seven Trillion cubic feet (187,000,000,000,000 ft3) of Gas and urged the Oil and Gas Industry to create innovative ways in harnessing this enormous potential.

3. That a good pipeline integrity management system would go a long way in managing the pipelines and preventing losses. The workshop concluded that vandalisation of pipeline coupled with massive corrosion are the major challenges confronting pipeline management in the country and recommended that to manage pipelines effectively, Nigeria must grow its domestic Gas market, bridge the supply gap issues in the supply chain by reducing gas flaring for higher gas recovery to meet power needs, stimulation of investment in hydrocarbon pipeline gathering system, ensure enhanced domestic pipelines security operations, safety and control of vandalism, criminal activity, aerial surveillance among others.

4. That to effectively curtail losses due to pipeline vandalism, Nigeria must overcome the toxic and explosive relationship between the Government, corporate establishments and their host communities.

5. The workshop identified the Petroleum Training Institute as a veritable agency for mediation between Government, corporate bodies and host communities to achieving lasting industrial harmony through public enlightenment, technical skills acquisition programmes, competency building for the youth and conflict resolution workshop.

6. The workshop urged the Government to hasten the passage of the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB) to attract the requisite Foreign Direct Investment (FDl) into the Oil and Gas Industry.

7. Government should activate the steel industry in order to establish the basic steel infrastructure for easy access to steel products and its auxiliary facilities for effective pipeline management.

8. The workshop commended the efforts of the Government on its crusade against corruption and urged Government to utilize the facilities and man power of PTl for management, in its attempts at curtailing corruption and sharp practices.

9. The workshop encouraged the Petroleum Training Institute to develop a comprehensive programme in Pipeline Engineering towards the effective management of pipelines in the country.

10. The workshop urged the Government to enact relevant legislations and provide sustainable enforcement structures in ensuring the protection of the nation's pipelines. It was reiterated that all stakeholders should partner in conjunction with the National Assembly for the promulgation of requisite laws against pipeline vandalism and their implementation.

11. The workshop urged the Department of Petroleum Resources (DPR) to engage the services of Petroleum Training Institute (PTl) in ensuring that petroleum products imported into the country meet acceptable standards in terms of safety, quality and customer expectations.
